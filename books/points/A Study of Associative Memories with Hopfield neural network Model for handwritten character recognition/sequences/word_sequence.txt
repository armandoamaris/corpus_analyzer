neural
network
is
the
most
important
model
which
has
been
studied
in
past
decades
by
keywords
several
researchers
hopfield
model
is
one
of
the
network
model
proposed
by
j.j
bidirectional
associative
hopfield
that
describes
the
organization
of
neurons
in
such
way
that
they
function
as
memory
bams
and
associative
memory
or
also
called
content
addressable
memory
this
is
recurrent
multidirectional
associative

similar
to
recurrent

of
the
hamming
network
but
which
can

has
always
been
interesting
problems
to

of
work
is
going

we
will

introduction
this
paper
deals
with
the
basics
of
artificial
neural
networks
ann
and
their
applications
in
handwritten
characters
recognition
ann
can
be
viewed
as
computing
models
inspired
by
the
structure
and
function
of
the
biological
neural
network
these
models
are
expected
to
deal
with
problem
solving
in
manner
different
from
conventional
computing
distinction
is
made
between
pattern
and
data
to
emphasize
the
need
for
developing
pattern
processing
systems
to
address
handwritten
characters
recognition
tasks
after
introducing
the
basic
principles
of
ann
some
fundamental
networks
are
examined
in
detail
for
their
ability
to
solve
hindi
handwritten
characters
recognition
these
fundamental
networks
together
with
the
principles
of
ann
will
lead
to
the
development
of
architectures
for
complex
handwritten
characters
recognition
tasks
few
popular
architectures
are
described
to
illustrate
the
need
to
develop
an
architecture
specific
to
given
handwritten
characters
recognition
problem
finally
several
issues
that
still
need
to
be
addressed
to
solve
practical
problems
using
ann
approach
are
discussed
1
one
of
the
most
common
applications
of
nn
is
in
image
processing
some
examples
would
be
identifying
hand
written
characters
matching
photograph
of
person's
face
with
different
photo
in
database
performing
data
compression
on
an
image
with
minimal
loss
of
content
other
applications
could
be
voice
recognition
radar
signature
analysis
stock
market
prediction
all
of
these
problems
involve
large
amounts
of
data
and
complex
relationships
between
the
different
parameters
2
functionally
also
humans
and
machines
differ
in
the
sense
that
humans
understand
patterns
whereas
machines
can
be
said
to
recognize
patterns
in
data
in
other
words
humans
can
get
the
whole
object
in
the
data
even
though
there
may
be
no
clear
identification
of
sub
patterns
in
the
data
for
example
consider
the
name
of
person
written
in
handwritten
cursive
script
3
even
though
individual
patterns
for
each
letter
may
not
be
evident
the
name
is
understood
due
to
the
visual
hints
provided
in
the
written
script
likewise
speech
is
understood
even
though
the
patterns
corresponding
to
individual
sounds
may
be
distorted
sometimes
to
unrecognizable
extents
another
major
characteristic
of
human
being
is
the
ability
to
continuously
learn
from
examples
which
is
not
well
understood
at
all
in
order
to
implement
it
in
an
algorithmic
fashion
in
machine
human
beings
are
capable
of
making
mental
patterns
in
their
biological
neural
network
from
input
data
given
in
the
form
of
numbers
text
pictures
sounds
etc
using
their
sensory
mechanisms
of
vision
sound
touch
smell
and
taste
these
mental
patterns
are
formed
even
when
the
data
are
noisy
or
deformed
due
to
variations
such
as
translation
rotation
and
scaling
the
patterns
are
also
formed
from
temporal
sequence
of
data
as
in
the
case
of
speech
and
motion
pictures
humans
have
the
ability
to
recall
the
stored
patterns
even
when
the
input
information
is
noisy
or
partial
incomplete
or
study
of
associative
memories
with
hopfield
neural
network
model
for
handwritten
character
recognition
mixed
with
information
pertaining
to
other
patterns
4
an
association
is
an
input-output
pair
associative
memory
also
known
as
content-addressable
memory
is
memory
organization
that
accesses
memory
by
its
content
instead
of
its
address
it
picks
up
desirable
match
from
all
stored
prototypes
an
associative
memory
can
be
auto-associative
or
hetero-associative
the
architecture
of
an
associative
memory
network
may
be
feed
forward
bidirectional
or
recurrent
the
hopfield
model
and
the
boltzmann
machine
are
popular
auto-associative
memories
4].associative
memories
are
useful
for
pattern
recognition
and
pattern
association
when
an
incomplete
or
corrupted
sample
is
presented
to
the
neural
network
the
network
is
required
to
recall
the
stored
correct
pattern
5
neural
network
has
many
applications
the
most
likely
applications
for
the
neural
networks
are
1
classification
2
association
and
3
reasoning
one
of
the
applications
of
neural
networks
is
in
the
field
of
pattern
recognition
pattern
recognition
is
branch
of
artificial
intelligence
concerned
with
the
classification
or
description
of
observations
its
aim
is
to
classify
patterns
based
on
either
priori
knowledge
or
on
the
features
extracted
from
the
patterns
pattern
recognition
is
the
recognition
or
separation
of
one
particular
sequence
of
bits
or
pattern
from
other
such
patterns
pattern
recognition
pr
applications
have
been
varied
and
so
also
the
associated
data
structures
and
processing
paradigms
in
the
course
of
time
four
significant
approaches
to
pr
have
evolved
in
this
paper
we
have
described
method
used
in
our
research
work
for
the
recognition
of
handwritten
character
in
the
proposed
work
we
have
used
neural-network
technique
in
the
first
phase
and
then
the
euclidean
distance
metric
is
used
to
improve
the
recognition

currently
we
are
developing

we
have

from

writers
were
provided
with
the

and
each
writer
has
asked
to
write
hindi

from

for
one
time
the
database
is
totally
unconstrained
and
has
been
created
for
validating
the

hopfield
neural
network
hnn
the
hopfield
neural
network
was
introduced
by
hopfield
in
1982
which
introduced
the
climax
of
the
research
on
the
neural
networks
this
network
was
extended
to
bidirectional
associative
memory
bam
neural
network
by
kosko
in
1987
and
to
multidirectional
associative
memory
mam
neural
network
by
hagiwara
in
1990
they
all
can
realize
associative
memory
but
by
using
the
mam
neural
networks
one
can
achieve
the
many-to-many
association
which
is
very
advanced
function
of
human
brain
the
many-to-many
association
has
found
wide
applications
in
image
de
noising
speech
recognition
pattern
recognition
and
intelligent
information
processing
for
example
it
was
shown
that
today
most
indians
are

if
we
need
to
distinguish

and
recognition
we
have
obtained
