abstract—this
paper
describes
the
use
of
novel
a
path
planning
algorithm
for
performing
line
segmentation
of
hand
written
documents
the
novelty
of
the
proposed
approach
lies
in
the
use
of
smart
combination
of
simple
soft
cost
functions
that
allow
an
artificial
agent
to
compute
paths
separating
the
upper
and
lower
text
fields
the
use
of
soft
cost
functions
allow
the
agent
to
compute
near-optimal
separating
paths
even
if
the
upper
and
lower
text
parts
are
overlapping
in
particular
places
experimental
results
on
several
medieval
historical
and
contemporary
handwritten
manuscripts
show
that
the
proposed
method
needs
little
tuning

performs
very
well

introduction
current
search
engines
are
very
useful
for
people
to
search
for
information
on
the
internet
however
there
is
still
lot
of
information
available
on
the
internet
that
cannot
be
used
efficiently
because
this
information
is
contained
in
documents
that
cannot
be
read
or
understood
in
an
effective
way
by
current
search
engine
technology
we
are
especially
interested
in
making
handwritten
documents
accessible
to
people
by
recognizing
the
contents
of
these
documents
and
making
them
searchable
with
new
generation
of
search
engines
tailored
to
handwritten
documents
the
world
digital
library
consists
of
collection
of
millions
of
handwritten
historical
manuscripts
maps
photographs
and
other
cultural
documents
several
projects
focus
on
disclosing
this
information
to
the
public
the
digital
dead
sea
scrolls
ddss
project
allows
people
to
explore
the
ancient
dead
sea
scroll
manuscripts
and
in
this
project
several
advanced
imaging
and
web
technologies
have
been
developed
the
technology
behind
the
ddss
project
allows
the
user
to
retrieve
the
manuscript
images
and
translations
so
that
people
can
have
access
to
this
important
historical
information
the

system
is
historical
manuscript

system
consisting
of
many
techniques
for

ing
for

in

collections
the
system
consists
of
different
handwriting

algorithms
which
are
trained
by
crowd

techniques
where
people
all
over
the
world
can
create
ground-truth

for

we

algo
rithm
for
handwritten
documents
line
segmentation
is
one
of
the
first
techniques
that
needs
to
be
applied
to
document
before
individual
words
or
characters
can
be
found
and
parts
of
the
handwritten
text
can
be
automatically
recognized
our
method
is
based
on
a
path-planning
3
and
combines
this
well-known
method
with
different
cost
functions
to
find
near
optimal
paths
separating
upper
and
lower
handwritten
text
areas
by
using
soft
cost
functions
our
method
can
find
very
good
separating
lines
even
if
upper
and
lower
text
parts
are
overlapping
in
some
areas
related
work
the
first
step
that
is
performed
by
line
segmentation
algorithm
is
to
find
potential
candidates
for
starting
points
of
lines
separating
upper
and
lower
text
fields
most
often
this
step
uses
horizontal
projection
profiles
in
which
the
amount
of
black
ink
is
summed
over
the
x-axis
to
obtain
profile
indicating
text
areas
having
lot
or
little

of

in

the
handwritten
document
is
divided
into
chunks
and
then
the
smoothed
projection
profile
in
each
chunk
is
calculated
then
the
valleys
in
the
projection
profile
are
considered
as
the
starting
state
of
the
text
lines
also
in

the
baselines
of
the
valleys
are
used
to
define
the
starting
states
for
the
separating
lines
after
defining
the
starting
states
various
methods
for
finding
the
line

upper

ares
have
been

developed
beginning
in
the
starting

first
an
initial
straight
path
is
generated
then
the

image
is
turned
90
degrees
and
an
artificial
water
droplet
is
moved
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
page
this
droplet
tries
to
move
around
the
ink
along
the
straight
path
with
the
aim
to
preserve
the
ascenders
and
descenders
in
the
final

although
these
previous

perform
well

they
still
suffer
from

in

therefore
the
aim

to

and
to
obtain

this
paper
proposes
novel
line

method
based
on
the
a
path-planning
algorithm
this
well-known
path-planning
algorithm
is
combined
with
number
of
cost
functions
to
determine
the
optimal
path
separating
upper

the
cost
functions
have
been
designed
in
order
to
allow
the
separating
path
to
go
through
text
areas
which
is
very
useful
in
case
upper

lower
text
fields
are
overlapping
or

the
a
path-planning
algorithm
has
been
widely
used
in
the
field
of
artificial

however
this
paper
shows
that
this
technique
can
also
be
very
beneficial
for
line
segmentation
purposes
we
have
performed
experiments
on

the
aim
of

is
discovering

the

contains
many
obstacles
hence
the
a
algorithm
acquires
some
knowledge
to
compute
the
cost
function
from
the
envi

the
a
path-planning
algorithm
uses
the
heuristic
function
to
discover
and
appropriate

to
reach
the
goal
state
it
combines
the
cost
of
the
actual
path
and
the
heuristic
function
to
estimate
cost
from
the
given
state
to
the
goal

the
equation
is
defined
as
follows
f(n)=g(n)+
n
1
where
n
is
the
actual
traveling
cost
from
the
starting
state
to
reach
state
n
therefore
the
n
of
each
state
indicates
the
total

n
is
the
heuristic

the
heuristic
function
which
provides
the

uses
the

the
agent
that
applies
the
euclidean
distance
measurement
moves
more
realistically
than
the
manhattan
distance
consequently
the
euclidean

produces
the

the

the
cost
of
10
for

directions
and
the

the
reason
is
that
the
diagonal

distance
is
approximately
1.4
times
longer
than
distance
of
the
horizontal

generally
the

b
the
proposed
s-directional
movement
this
approach
for
the
a
path-planning
algorithm
to
the
handwritten
historical
manuscripts
is
applied
we
have
used
s-directional
movement
as
shown
in
fig
6(b
preventing
the
agent
from
moving
backwards
in
order
to
apply
the
cost
function
in
fig

by
the
low
value
of
n
the
line
is
made
more
straight
the
n
controls
the
agent
not
to
move
far
away
from
s
whereas
in
fig

the
agent
moves
more
flexible
from
s
with
the
high
value
furthermore
fig
is
applying
n
the
distance
cost
is
set
to
0.9
the
proposed
a
path-planning
algorithm
can
now
be
described
by
the
following
equation
f(n)=g"(n)+
n
“
where
n
is
the
heuristic
cost
as
before
and
g

equation
is
defined

experimental
evaluation
the
line
segmentation
system
is
applied
on
two
handwrit
ten
historical
manuscripts
from
the
monk
and
the
saint
gall
dataset
results
of
the
novel
a
path-planning
algorithm
are
shown
in
fig
8
the
text
lines
are
separated
by
the
optimal
path
i.e
the
path
with
the
lowest
cost
firstly
the
handwritten
historical
manuscripts
are
binarized
using
sauvola’s
algorithm
secondly
the
smoothed
horizontal
ink
density
histogram
of
the
binary
image
is
calculated
then
peaks
of
the
horizontal
ink
density
histogram
are
detected
by
the
local
maxima
method
the
starting
state
of
each
line
is
set
between
each
peak
finally
the
novel
a
path-planning
algorithm
is
applied
most
importantly
the
agent
of
the
algorithm
allow
to
move
through
the
handwritten
texts
some
output
samples
of
our
method
are
shown
in
fig
9
the
ground
truth
is
acquired
manually
with
the
help
of
tool
developed
for
this
task
this
tool
presents
scanned
document
in
web
page
and
allows
the
human
user
to
mark
handwritten
text
with
the
mouse
pointer
by
selecting
vertical
area
denoted
by
two
y-values
in
the
image
using
javascript
see
fig
10
after
annotating
these
text
lines
the
page
image
is
split
as
follows
for
each
line
annotation
the
area
above
and
below
the
line
area
are
whitened
in
copy
of
the
original
image
this
preserves
the
original
image
size
descenders
and
ascenders
from
the
lines
above
and
below
respectively
are
not
removed
by
this
process
they
are
removed
manually
by
whitening
them
with
simple
paint
program
e.g
xpaint
both
the
input
images
and
output
images
are
losslessly
compressed
to
prevent
any
influence
from
lossy
compression
artefacts
each
line
annotation
image
is
named
as
the
original
image
appended
with
line
number
this
allows
the
matching
of
the
ground

with

v
conclusion
in
this
paper
novel
a
path-planning
algorithm
is
pro
posed
which
uses
the
minimum
and
distance
cost
function
to
control
the
line
segmentation
agent
the
a
algorithm
is
com
puted
on
the
binarized
image
by
using
the
smoothed
horizontal
ink
density
histogram
the
starting
state
is
determined
the
optimal
path
of
the
line
segmentation
is
generated
using
the
a
path-planning
algorithm
the
novel
cost
function
consists
of
the
minimum
distance
and
the
neighbor
cost
function
by
using
s-directional
movement
the
agent
cannot
move
backwards
the
novel
a
path-planning
algorithm
is
successful
in
dividing
the
overlapping
text
lines
the
cost
function
prevents
the
agent
from
moving
far
away
from
the
initial
y-value
and
allows
the

to
move
