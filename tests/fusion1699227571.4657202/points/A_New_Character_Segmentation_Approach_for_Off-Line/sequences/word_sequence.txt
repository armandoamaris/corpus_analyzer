abstract
character
segmentation
is
the
most
crucial
step
for
any
ocr
optical
character
recognition
system
the
selection
of
segmentation
algorithm
being
used
is
the
key
factor
in
deciding
the
accuracy
of
ocr
system
if
there
is
good
segmentation
of
characters
the
recognition
accuracy
will
also
be
high
segmentation
of
words
into
characters
becomes
very
difficult
due
to
the
cursive
and
unconstrained
nature
of
the
handwritten
script
this
paper
proposes
new
vertical
segmentation
algorithm
in
which
the
segmentation
points
are
located
after
thinning
the
word
image
to
get
the
stroke
width
of
asingle
pixel
the
knowledge
of
shape
and
geometry
of
english
characters
is
used
in
the
segmentation
process
to
detect

approach
is
tested
on
local

is
found
to
be
achieved

1.1
historical
background
in
the
literature
for
achieving
high
recognition
accuracy
several
segmentation
techniques
are
proposed
that
can
be
broadly
classified
into
three
categories
namely
explicit
segmentation
pure
segmentation
implicit
segmentation
recognition
based
segmentation
and
segmentation
free
holistic
approaches
2
the
segmentation
approach
proposed
in
this
paper
lies
in
the
category
of
explicit
segmentation
or
pure
segmentation
when
classical
approach
is
adopted
for
recognition
segmentation
becomes
the
most
crucial
step
of
the
handwritten
word
recognition
problem
in
classical
approach
input
word
image
of
sequence
of
characters
is
portioned
into
sub
images
of
individual
characters
which
are
then
classified
the
process
of
cutting
up
the
word
images
into
classifiable
character
sub
images
is
termed
as
dissection
many
researchers
in
the
literature
adopted
this
dissection
based
segmentation
techniques

these
techniques
are
used
to
find
all
the
interconnections
between
character
images
also
called
ligatures
and
cut
the
word
image
through
all
the
detected
ligatures
the
key
letters
present
in
the
cursive
script
provided
the
clue
for
character
segmentation
6
to
extract
key
letters
face-up
and
face-down
valleys
along
with
open
loop
regions
in
cumsive
script
are
detected
finally

was
used

system
were
investigated

rate
was
91.7%
with
lexicon

of
50
words
segmentation
of
handwritten
cursive
words
based
on
natural

was
hypothesized
9
accordingly
natural

mentation
points
were
analyzed
using
histogram
projection
taken
from
five
different
angles
and
ligature
candidates
obtained
from
morphological
operations
of
opening
and
closing
to
search

elements
to
determine
ligature
in
the
set
of

algorithm
was
employed
1.2
various
challenges
during
segmentation
off-line
handwritten
word
segmentation
is
subject
of
much
attention
due
to
the
presence
of
many
difficulties
suchas
there
can
be
variation
in
shapes
and
writing
styles
of
different
writers
cursive
nature
of
handwriting
i.e
two
ormore
characters
in
word
can
be
written
connected
to
each
other
characters
can
have
more
than
oneshapeaccording
to
their
position
inside
the
word
image
words
may
be
written
by
pen
having
ink
of
different
colors
some
characters
e.g
u
and
v
in
handwritten
word
image
can
have
similar
contours
some
characters
can
give
the
illusion
of
presence
of
two
similar
characters
e.g
w
can
be
segmented
into
two
v
and
v
characters

motivation
and
contribution
english
language
is
used
by
much
higher
percentage
of
the
world’s
population
people
will
be
benefited
all
over
the
globe
if
an
automation
system
is
designed
for
off-line
handwriting
recognition
the
off-line
handwriting
recognition
systemenables
the
automatic
reading
and
processing
ofa
large
amount
of
data
printed
or
handwritten
in
english
language
although
such
automated
systems
for
recognizing
off-line
handwriting
already
exist
the
scope
of
further
improvement
is
always
there
new
vertical
segmentation
technique
is
developed
to
enhance
the
over-segmentation
of
the
handwritten
word
image
by
thinning
the
word
image
to
single
pixel
width
the
objective
of
the
proposed
approach
is
to
over-segment
the
handwritten
word
image
sufficient
number
of
times
to
ensure
that
all
possible
character
boundaries
have
been
dissected
another
technique
is
also
developed
to
merge
more
than
one
successive
potential
segmentation
points
present
between
any
two
characters
into
single
segmentation
point
to
enhance
the
segmentation
performance
2
techniques
and
methodologies
the
selection
of
segmentation
technique
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
script
to
be
segmented
the
proposed
segmentation
approach
in
this
work
is
developed
for
segmenting
touched
handwritten
characters
from
the
words
written
in
english
language

the
aim
of
pre-processing
is
to
eliminate
the
inconsistency
that
is
inherent
in
cursive
handwritten
words
the
handwriting
samples
may
be
written
on
noisy
or
coloured
background
and
also
the
quality
of
the
word
images
may
be
degraded
due
to
the
noise
that
is
introduced
in
the
process
of
scanning
or
capturing
the

it
is
necessary
to
remove

to
improve
the
quality
of
the

to
be
used
in
the

the
outcome
of
the

techniques
which
has
been
employed
in
an
attempt
to
increase

segmentation
technique
many
segmentation
techniques
have
been
developed
by
the
researchers
in
the
recent
years
these
techniques
are
basically
script
dependent
and
may
not
work
well
if
applied
for
segmentation
of
words
written
in
any
other
script
for
example
the
technique
developed
for
segmenting
touched
characters
in
roman
script
may
not
work
well
to
segment
touched
characters
of
word
written
in
arabic
or
chinese
script
3.1
overview
there
are
two
types
of
characters
in
english
language
first
type
of
characters
are
called
closed
characters
and
contain
loop
ora
semi-loop
such
as
a
b
c
d
‘
g
0
p
s
etc
second
type
of
characters
are
termed
as
open
characters
and
are
without
loop
or
semi-loop
e.g
u
v
w
m
n
i
etc
in
case
of
open
characters
it
is
very
difficult
to
differentiate
between
ligatures
and
characters
because
of
the
cumsive
nature
of
handwriting
in
case
of
cursive
handwritten
words
ligature
is
link
small
foreground
component
which
is
present
between
two
successive
characters
to
join
them
two
consecutive
i
characters
may
give
an
illusion
of
the
presence
of
character
u
and
vise
versa
two
consecutive
characters
n
and
i
may
look
like
m
also
w
may
look
like
the
presence
of
two
consecutive
characters
u
and
i
to
overcome
such
type
of
challenges
in
the
domain
of
cursive
handwriting
segmentation
and
recognition
new
segmentation
approach
is
developed
which
is
based
on
the
analysis
of
the
character’s
geometric
features
such
as
the
shape
of
the
character
to
identify
the
characters
and
the
ligatures
3.2
methodology
after
the
preprocessing
of
the
input
handwritten
word
image
the
height
and
width
of
the
word
image
is
calculated
for
the
analysis
of
the
ligatures
in
an
accurate
manner
2
the
word
image
is
scanned
vertically
from
top
to
bottom
column
wise
and
the
number
of
foreground
pixels
in
the
inverted
word
image
are
counted
in
each
column
the
positions
of
all
these
columns
are
saved
for
which
the
sum
of
foreground
black
pixels
is
either
or
1
all
these
identified
columns
are
termed
as
psc
potential
segmentation
columns
as
shown
in
fig
d
3.3
over-segmentation
problem
many
consecutive
psc
are
present
in
various
groups
in
the
whole
word
image
where
sum
of
foreground
pixels
are
or
1
this
situation
can
be
termed
as
over-segmentation
as
shown
in
fig
3(d
the
over-segmentation
problem
is
occurred
in
three
cases
first
when
the
two
consecutive
characters
in
the
word
image
are
not
touching
each
other
and
the
sum
of
foreground
pixels
of
the
columns
in
this
area
are
0
second
when
the
two
consecutive
characters
in
the
word
image
are
connected
by
ligature
and
the
sum
of
foreground
pixels
in
these
columns
crossing
this
ligature
are
1
third
when
the
characters
are
open
characters
like
u
w
m
n
etc
without
having
any
loop
orsemi-loop
ligature
is
present
within
all
of
these
open
characters
due
to
the
presence
of
this
ligature-within-character
the
characters
of
such
type
in
the
word
image
are
still
over-segmented
and
the
sum
of
foreground
pixels
in
these
columns
is
also
1
3.4
solution
of
over-segmentation
problem
when
there
is
clear
vertical
space
between
two
consecutive
characters
in
word
image
the
problem
of
over-segmentation
is
eliminated
by
taking
average
of
all
the
psc
present
in
that
area
as
the
sum
of
foreground

pixels
for
all
these
psc
columns
is
0
when
there
is
ligature
between
two
consecutive
characters
or
there
is
ligature-within-character
open
characters
such
as
w
m
etc
the
over-segmentation
is
eliminated
to
great
extent
by
taking
average
of
those
psc
which
are
at
distance
less
than
particular
value
threshold
and
by
merging
them
into
single
sc
segmentation
column
the
threshold
value
is
the
minimum
distance
along
the
width
of
the
word
image
between
consecutive
pscs
and
is
so
chosen
that
its
value
must
be
less
than
the
width
of
the
thinnest
character
possible
e.g
‘
i
in
word
image
by
experimenting
several
times
the
value
of
threshold
is
set
to
value
7
this
means
that
all
those
pscs
which
are
separated
by
distance
of
pixels
or
less
by
another
psc
will
be
merged
to
single
sc
4
implementation
in
the
first
step
preprocessed
word
images
after
thinning
are
taken
as
input
images
to
be
segmented
into
characters
as
shown
in
fig
3(a
to
minimize
the
computation
comp
lexity
the
input
word
images
are
inverted
to
make
themsuitable
for
further
processing
by
complementing
the
input
binary
images
white
pixels
become
the
foreground
pixels
and
the
black
pixels
become
the
background
pixels
as
shown
in
fig
3(b
hence
it
becomes
easier
to
count
the
foreground
white
pixels
represented
by
1
in
each
column
of
the
word
images
these
images
are
now
converted
from
binary
format
to
rgb
format
as
shown
in
fig
3(c
now
it
becomes
computationally
easier
to
display
the
psc
potential
segmentation
columns
in
different
color
other
than
black
and
white
all
pscs
over-segmenting
the
word
image
are
printed
in
red
color
as
shown

evaluation
of
the
proposed
segmentation
approach
200
handwritten
word
samples
were
selected
from
the
handwriting
samples
of
10
different
writers
the
performance
of
the
proposed
segmentation
approach
was
judged
on
the
basis
of
segmentation
errors
of
the
three
types
namely
number
of
over
seg
mentations
number
of
missed
segmentations
and
number
of
bad
segmentations

such

counted
in
both

ie
counted

similarly
in
some
words
the
correct
segmentation
point
was
missed
and
shifted
to
some
other
place
resulting
in

it
is
very
difficult
to
compare
the
segmentation
results
achieved
by
the
proposed
approach
with
the
segmentation
results
of
some
other
researchers
because
different
researchers
used
different
databases
of
handwritten
words
and
reported
the
segmentation
results
under
various
constraints
such
as
some
researchers
assumed
the
absence
of
noise
some
researchers
collected
the
handwriting
samples
from
different
number
of
writers
and
so
on
although
some
researchers
10
11
used
various
benchmark
databases
e.g
cedar
or
iam
for
their
experiment
but
they
used
different
number
of
words
from
the
benchmark
database
as
the
character
segmentation
in
word
images
is
done
before
the
character
recognition
phase
most
of
the
researchers
mentioned
only
the
recognition
results
and
not
the
segmentation
results
6
conclusions
and
future
scope
the
proposed
segmentation
approach
guaranteed
correct
segmentation
when
characters
in
word
image
were
not
touching
each
other
this
approach
also
delivered
excellent
results
in
case
of
segmentation
of
ligatures
present
between
consecutive
closed
characters
it
also
minimized
the
problem
of
over-segmentation
that
appeared
during
segmentation
of
open
characters
the
presence
of
over-segmentation
in
case
of
open
characters
was
due
to
the
presence
of
ligatures-within-characters
in
case
of
open
characters
ligature-within
characters
were
sometimes
appeared
as
they
are
ligature
between
two
consecutive
characters
and
were

segmented
by
the
proposed
technique
although
the
segmentation
accuracy
of
83.5%
obtained
was
very
favourably
yet
there
is
always
scope
of
improvement
in
future
better
pre-processing
techniques
will
be
used
specially
the
thinning
technique
the
skew
and
slat
correction
module
will
be
incorporated
in
the
future
work
this
module
was
not
applied
here
in
this
work
because
it
was
assumed
that
all
the
handwritten
word
samples
are
free
from
slant
and
skew
some
intelligent
technique
to
validate
the
correct
segmentation
points
e.g
neural-based
validation
will
be
applied
to
further
improve
the
segmentation
accuracy
in
future
