abstract
segmentation
of
highly
slanted
and
horizontally
overlapped
characters
is
challenging
research
area
that
is
still
fresh
several
techniques
are
reported
in
the
state
of
art
but
produce
low
accuracy
for
the
highly
slanted
characters
segmentation
and
cause
overall
low
handwriting
recognition
precision
accordingly
this
paper
presents
simple
yet
effective
approach
for
character
segmentation
of
such
difficult
slanted
cursive
words
without
using
any
slant
correction
technique
rather
new
concept
of
core-zone
is
introduced
for
segmenting
such
difficult
slanted
handwritten
words
however
due
to
the
inherent
nature
of
cursive
words
few
characters
are
over-segmented
and
therefore
threshold
is
selected
heuristically
to
overcome
this
problem
for
fair
comparison
difficult
words
are
extracted
from
the
iam
benchmark
database
experiments
thus
performed

introduction
and
background
segmentation
of
handwritten
words
is
long-standing
problem
at
the
heart
of
systems
for
conversion
of
handwritten
information
to
electronic
form
1-5
this
problem
becomes
crucial
for
highly
slanted
and
horizontally
overlapped
cursive
words
the
literature
is
replete
with
high
accuracy
recognition
for
separated
handwritten
numerals
and
characters
6-12
however
segmentation
and
recognition
of
characters
extracted
from
cursive
touching
and
horizontally
overlapped
do
not
have
the
same
measure
of
success
13-18
accurate
segmentation
is
the
difficult
phase
for
correct
and
speedy
recognition
particularly
in
the
context
of
segmentation-based
word
recognition
19-22
still
there
are
several
reasons
why
we
may
find
an
advantage
in
more
accurate
and
reliable
word
image
segmentation
firstly
for
the
reason
of
efficiency
we
would
like
to
keep
the
number
of
segmentations
as
less
as
possible
secondly
each
possible
segmentation
point
in
the
image
requires
some
resolution
of
target
character
which
could
extend
the
time
of
character
image
recognition
significantly
23-27
the
segmentation
is
the
backbone
of
the
recognition
process
and
is
still
an
active
research
area
hence
higher
character
segmentation
accuracy
is
directly
proportional
to
handwriting
recognition
accuracy
28-32
researchers
have
acknowledged
the
important
role
that
segmentation
plays
in
the
handwriting
recognition
process
33-37
that
is
why
more
innovative
accurate
and
fast
techniques
need
to
be
employed
and
compared
to
the
work
of
other
researchers
using
benchmark
databases
38,39
however
the
words
that
are
highly
slanted
and
overlapped
horizontally
cannot
be
correctly
segmented
despite
slant
correction
techniques
40,41
this
paper
presents
simple
but
effective
approach
for
segmenting
such
difficult
cursive
words
extracted
from
benchmark
dataset
in
the
proposed
approach
rather
performing
complex
slant
correction
preprocessing
techniques
word

height
is
detected
segmentation
performed
in
the
core
zone
yields
better
results
with
high
speed
once
character
boundaries
are
found
difficult
slanted
and
horizontally
overlapped
characters
can
be
detected

the

to

for

do

likewise
to
segment
horizontally
overlapped
characters
we
introduced
simple
concept
of
word
core-zone
height
core-zone
is
the
area
that
lies
between
the
lower
baseline
and
upper
baseline
of
the
word
again
very
simple
and
fast
technique
is
proposed
to
calculate
lower
and
upper
baselines
from
top
left
point
count
number
of
white
pixels
row
by
row
calculate
the
average
of
those
rows
for
which
there
is
change
in
count
between
current
and
preceding
row
until
the
first
big
change
occurs
an
average
row
represents
the
upper
baseline
the
same
procedure
is
adopted
for
the
lower
baseline
but
from
bottom
to
top
results
of
the
core
zone
detection
for
difficult
words
are

proposed

for

is
presented
as
follow
step
1
take

image
from
iam
database
step
2
perform

step
3
determine
core-zone
height
step
4.in
the
core

calculate
the
sum
of
foreground
pixels
white
pixels
for
each
column
save
those
columns
as
candidate
segment
column
csc
for
which
sum
is
orl
step
5
by
the
previous
step
we
have
more
candidate
segmentation
columns
than
actually
required
threshold
is
selected
empirically
from
candidate
segment
columns
to
come
out
with
correct
segment
columns
threshold
is
constant
value
that
is
derived
after
number
of
experiments
to
avoid
over-segmentation
due
to
the
simplicity
of
the
proposed
segmentation
technique
it
is
very
fast
and
performs
well
in
most
of
the
cases
for
few
characters
such
as
w
u
v
m
etc
over
segmentation
occurs
and
this
technique
fails
to
find
accurate
character
boundaries
however
this
problem
is
solved
heuristically
by
selecting

and

while
for

we
faced
the
problem
of

due
to

as
shown
in

similarly
the
problem
of

and
therefore
accurate

were
rejected
as
they

likewise

due
