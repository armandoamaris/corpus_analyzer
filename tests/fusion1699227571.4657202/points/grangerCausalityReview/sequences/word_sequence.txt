introduced
more
than
half
century
ago
granger
causality
has
become
popular
tool
for
analyzing
time
series
data
in
many
application
domains
from
economics
and
finance
to
genomics
and
neuroscience
despite
this
popularity
the
validity
of
this
notion
for
inferring
causal
relationships
among
time
series
has
remained
the
topic
of
continuous
debate
moreover
while
the
original
definition
was
general
limitations
in
computational
tools
have
primarily
limited
the
applications
of
granger
causality
to
simple
bivariate
vector
auto-regressive
processes
or
pairwise
relationships
among
set
of
variables
starting
with
review
of
early
developments
and
debates
this
paper
discusses
recent
advances
that
address
various
shortcomings
of
the
earlier
approaches
from
models
for
high-dimensional
time
series
to
more
recent
developments
that
account
for
nonlinear
and
non-gaussian
observations
and
allow
for
sub-sampled
and
mixed
frequency
time
series
introduction
there
is
range
of
applications
where
the
interest
is
in
understanding
interactions
between
set
of
time
series
including
in
neuroscience
genomics
econometrics
climate
science
and
social
media
analysis
for
example
in
neuroscience
one
may
seek
to
understand
whether
activity
in
one
brain
region
correlates
with
later
activity
in
another
region
or
to
decipher
instantaneous
correlations
between
regions—both
notions
of
functional
connectivity
in
genomics
there
is
an
analogous
study
of
gene
regulatory
networks
in
econo
metrics
one
may
be
interested
in
how
various
macroeconomic
indicators
predict
one
another
we
also
have
unprecedented
levels
of
data
on
people’s
actions—whether
they
be
social
media
posts
purchase
histories
or
political
voting
records—and
want
to
understand
the
dependencies
between
the
actions
of
these
individuals
modern
recording
modalities
and
the
ability
to
store
and
process
large
amounts
of
data
have
escalated
the
scale
at
which
we
seek
to
do
such
analyses
in
many
cases
one
may
seek
notions
of
causal
interactions
amongst
the
time
series
but
be
limited
to
drawing
inferences
from
observational
data
without
opportunities
for
experimentation
and
without
known
mechanistic
models
for
the
observed
phenomena
in
such
cases
39
put
forth
framework
leveraging
the
temporal
ordering
inherent
to
time
series
in
hopes
of
drawing
causal
statements
restricted
to
the
past
causing
the
future
the
framework
in
reality
assesses
whether
one
series
is
predictive
of
another
series
is
deemed
not
to
be
causal
of
another
series
z
if
leveraging
the
history
of
series
x
does
not
reduce
the
variance
of
the
prediction
of
series
x
in
this
review
we
distinguish
this
definition
from
other
standard
definitions
of
causality
by
referring
to
it
as
granger
causality
although
there
is
long
history
of
debate
about
the
validity
of
the
granger
causality
framework
for
causal
analyses—and
justly
so—in
this
review
we
take
the
stance
that
analyzing
interactions
in
time
series
defined
by
association
has
its
utility
granger
causality
has
traditionally
relied
on
assuming
linear
vector
autoregressive
var
model
liitkepohl
and
considering
tests
on
the
var
coefficients
in
the
bivariate
setting
however
in
real-world
systems
involving
many
time
series
considering
the
relationship
between
just
pair
of
series
can
lead
to
confounded
network
granger
causality
aims
to
adjust
for
possible
confounders
or
there
are
other
important
limitations
of
the
linear
var
model
underlying
standard
granger
causal
analysis
that
have
precluded
its
broad
utility
inferences
e.g
lutkepohl
jointly
consider
multiple
series
some
limiting
assumptions
include
assuming
i
real-valued
time
series
with
ii
linear
dynamics
dependent
on
iii
known
number
of
past
lagged
observations
with
iv
observations
available
at
fixed
discrete
sam
pling
rate
that
matches
the
time
scale
of
the
causal
structure
of
interest
in
contrast
modern
time
series
are
often
messy
in
ways
that
break
number
of
these
assumptions
including
through
non-linear
dynamics
and
irregular
sampling
recent
advances
have
pushed
the
envelope
on
where
granger
causality
can
be
applied
by
loosening
these
restrictions
in
variety
of
ways
we
review
some
of
these
advances
and
set
the
stage
for
further
developments

prediction

not

x
nonetheless
assuming
causal
effects
are
ordered
in
time
i.e
cause
before

granger
argued
that
under
some
assumptions
if
can
predict
then
there
must
be
mechanistic
i.e
causal
effect
that
is
predictability
implies
causality
we
explicitly
refer
to
this
definition
as
granger
causality
throughout
this
review
to
distinguish
it
from
other
formal
definitions
of
causality
while
the
definition
seems
general
and
does
not
rely
on
specific
modeling
assumptions
granger’s
original
argument
was
based
on
the
identifiability
of
unique

pointed
out
that
this
model
is
generally
not
identifiable
the
matrices
a
are
not
uniquely
defined
unless
is
diagonal
granger
referred
to
this
special
case—corresponding
to
the
well-known
vector
auto-regressive
var
model
liitkepohl
as
simple
causal
model
distinguishing
it
from
models
with
instantaneous
causal
effects
when
a°
has
nonzero
off-diagonal
entries
this
more
general
form
of
2
is
known
as
structural
vector
auto-regressive
svar
model
3
and
can
be
identified
under
certain
parameter
restrictions
kilian
and
liitkepohl
such
svar
are
further
considered
in
section
the
model
in
is
clearly
restrictive
and
does
not
dis)prove
the
presence
of
causal
effects
in
particular
there
are
number
of
implicit
and
explicit
restrictive
assumptions
required
for
the
s)var
model
to
be
an
appropriate
framework
for
identifying
granger
causal
relationships
continuous-valued
series
all
series
are
assumed
to
have
continuous-valued
observations
how
ever
many
interesting
data
sources—such
as
social
media
posts
or
health
states
of
an
individual—are
discrete-valued
linearity
the
true
data
generating
process
and
correspondingly
the
causal
effects
of
variables
on
each
other
is
assumed
to
be
linear
in
reality
many
real-world
processes
are
non-linear
discrete-time
the
sampling
frequency
is
assumed
to
be
on
discrete
regular
grid
matching
the
true
causal
time
lag
if
the
data
acquisition
rate
is
slower
or
otherwise
irregular
causal
effects
may
not
be
identifiable
likewise
the
analysis
of
point
processes
or
other
continuous-time
processes
is
precluded
known
lag
the
linear
dependency
on
history
of
lagged
observations
is
assumed
to
have
known
order
classically
the
order
was
not
estimated
and
taken
to
be
uniform
across
all
series
stationarity
the
statistics
of
the
process
are
assumed
time-invariant
whereas
many
complex
processes
have
evolving
relationships
e.g
brain
networks
vary
by
stimuli
and
user
activity
varies
over
time
and
context
perfectly
observed
the
variables
need
to
be
observed
without
measurement
errors
complete
system
all
relevant
variables
are
assumed
to
be
observed
and
included
in
the
analysis
i.e
there
are
no
unmeasured
confounders
this
is
stringent
requirement
especially
given
that
early
approaches
for
granger
causality
focused
on
the
bivariate
case—that
is
they
did
not
account
for
any
potential
confounders
the
above
requirements
were
discussed
in
granger’s
original
and
followup
papers
2001
and
extensively
by
other
authors
stokes
and
purdon|
by
|glymour
et
al.|(2019
unfortunately
each
of
the
above
requirements
is
unlikely
to
hold
in
practice
these
assumptions
are
also
not
verifiable
and
even
more
unlikely
to
hold
simultaneously
which
is
what
is
)
see
also
the
recent
review
required
for
the
identifiability
of
causal
effects
in
fact
granger
admitted
this
limitation
and
gave
examples
of
cases
where
causal
effects
could
not
be
identified
or
wrong
conclusions
could
be
drawn
however
in
each
case
he
presented
an
argument
for
why
the
example
did
not
violate
the
basic
principle
either
by
giving
justifications
through
an
alternative
model
|
or
by
adding
disclaimers
e.g
the
definition
cannot
be
applied
to
deterministic
or
perfectly
predictable
processes
the
debate
over
the
notion
of
causality
introduced
by
granger
has
continued
since
its
introduction
an
illustrative
example
is
the
commentary
by
who
used
granger
causality
to
show
that
the
u.s
gross
national
product
gnp
causes
sunspots
the
rebuttal
by
suggests
an
alternative
model
would
have
led
to
different
conclusion
despite
its
limitations
and
number
of
other
researchers
including
prominent
econometricians
have
argued
that
the
approach
can
be
used
to
identify
causal
effects
researchers
in
various
applied
domains
from
neuroscience
to
environmental
sciences
have
used
granger’s
framework
to
informally
draw
causal
conclusions
other
researchers
have
emphasized
the
limitations
of
the
approach
and
have
tried
to
distinguish
it
as
granger
causality
or
g-causality

while
limited
and
not
generally
informative
about
causal
effects
the
notion
of
granger
causality
can
lead
to
useful
insights
about
interactions
among
random
variables
observed
over
time
in
the
next
section
we
discuss
early
approaches
for
identifying
granger
causality
and
its
applications
in
various
domains
in
the
remaining
sections
we
discuss
approaches
that
aim
to
partially
address
some
of
the
limitations
of
the
original
granger
causality
framework
and
relax
some
of
the
requirements
discussed
above
2.2
early
approaches
and
applications
the
basic
definition
requires
that
all
relevant
information
is
accounted
for
when
testing
whether
series
granger
causes
series
y
however
early
methods
for
identifying
granger
causality
were
limited
to
bivariate
models
ignoring
the
effect
of
other
variables
in
his
original
paper
used
an
argument
based
on
spectral
representation
using
coherence
and
phase
to
motivate
the
original
definition
using
bivariate
version
of
the
svar
model
i.e
with
2
he
then
showed
that
when
a°
is
diagonal
i.e
simple
causal
model
var
model
granger
causality
corresponds
to
nonzero
entries

the

highlighting
the
limitation
of
bivariate
tests
of
granger
causality
in
spite
of
their
limitations
bivariate
tests
of
granger
causality
have
been
widely
used
in
many
application
areas
from
economics
and
finance
to
neuroscience
and
meteorology
in
the
next
section
we
discuss
recent
developments
that
aim
to
mitigate
this
limitation
by
analyzing

of

granger

the
limitations
of
identifying
granger
causality
using
bivariate
models—illustrated
in
the
three-variable
example
of
fig
have
long
been
known
and
discussed
in
the
literature
e.g
needing
to
account
for
many
variables
when
identifying
granger
causality
arises
in
at
least
two
settings
first
when
he
goal
is
to
investigate
granger
causality
between
two
or
handful
of
endogenous
variables
and
y
we
need
to
account
for
the
remaining
erogenous
variables
targeting
the
notion
of
all
other
relevant
information”—to
prevent
identifying
incorrect
granger
causal
relations
this
is
the
setting
illustrated
in
fig

and
is
common
in
macroeconomic
and
econometric
studies
methods
ased
on
summaries
of
exogenous
variables
using
e.g
latent
factors
have
been
commonly
used
to
achieve
his
in
the
second
setting
which
arises
naturally
in
the
study
of
many
physical
biological
and
social
systems
he
goal
is
to
investigate
the
relationships
among
all
the
variables
from
systems
perspective
in
this
case
all
variables
are
endogenous
for
instance
when
learning
gene
regulatory
networks
all
the
genes
in
given
iological
pathway
are
of
interest
similarly
when
studying
brain
connectivity
networks
the
goal
is
to
interrogate
interactions
among
all
regions
of
interests
rois
in
the
brain
these
applications
have
led
to
he
development
of
methods
for
identifying
granger
causal
relationships
among
large
set
of
variables
which
see

the

identifiability

also
provides
interpretation
for

the

the

in

unfortunately
the
set
of

that
satisfy
the
mtd

constraints
is
non-convex
since
the
locations
of
the
zeros
are
unknown
address
this
issue
by
adding
penalty
2(z
that
biases
the
solution
towards
the
uniqueness
constraints
this
regularization
also
aids
convergence
of
optimization
since
the
maximum

without

not

a,c
pe
k
classical
analysis
based
on
x
that
does
not
account
for
subsampling
would
incorrectly
estimate
lagged
granger
causal
effects
in
a
because
4
does
not
imply
that
4
0
and
vice
versa
similarly
estimation
of
structural
interactions
may
also
be
biased
if
subsampling
is
ignored
this
is
illustrated
in
fig
where
an
analysis
based
on
subsampled
data
identifies
no
lagged
causal
effect
between
and
z2
but
relatively
large
instantaneous
interaction
see
2019
for
further
details
and
examples
the
mixed
frequency
scenarios
fig
b)-(d
are
also
considered
by
and
involve
defining
sampling
rates
for
each
series
and
set
of
indicator
matrices
that
select
the
observed
time
points
from
despite
more
cumbersome
notation
the
resulting
process
follows
analogously
to
the
derivation
and
can
be
written
as
x

l&

where
x;_1
are
observed
lags
of
the
series
is
function
of
elements
of
a
and
follows
analogously
to
the
subsampled
case
using
elements
of
pre-multiplying
elements
of
c
as
in
the
subsampled
case
we
refer
to
parameterization
of

however
not
accounting

fig

not

leads
to
the
kind
of
mistaken
inferences
discussed
above
but
also
to
further
mistakes
unique
to
the
mixed-frequency
case
see

for
examples
while
both
lagged
granger
causality
and
instantaneous
structural
interactions
are
confounded
by
sub
sampling
and
mixed
frequency
settings
show
that
when
accounting
for
this
structure
we
may
under
some
conditions
still
estimate

their

a

demonstrates
that

for

the

specifically
a

if
there

this

this
result
applies
directly
to
the
standard
mixed-frequency
setting
where
one
series
is
observed
at

as
in

it
also
applies
to

since
there
exist
time
steps
where
one
series
is
observed
one
time
step
before
another
series
in
the
case
of
subsampling
if
the
instantaneous
causal
effects
follow

the

conclusion
in
the
first
part
of
this
paper
we
briefly
reviewed
classical
approaches
to
granger
causality
mentioned
some
of
their
applications
and
discussed
their
shortcomings
these
shortcomings
are
primarily
due
to
the
restrictive
and
unattainable
assumptions
that
are
needed
in
order
to
infer
causal
effects
from
time
series
data
which
was
the
original
premise
of
granger
causality
they
are
also
due
to
the
limitations
of
simple
approaches
that
were
historically
used
to
investigate
granger
causal
relations
in
the
second
part
of
the
paper
we
discussed
recent
efforts
to
relax
some
of
the
assumptions
made
by
classical
approaches
and/or
generalize
their
applicability
this
includes
investigating
granger
causal
relations
among
large
set
of
variables
automatic
lag
selection
accounting
for
non-stationarity
developing
flexible
methods
for
non-gaussian
and
non-continuous
observations
and
attempts
to
account
for
differences
between
the
true
causal
time
scale
and
the
frequency
of
the
observed
data
these
recent
developments
have
expanded
the
application
domains
of
granger
causality
and
offer
new
opportunities
for
investigating
interactions
among
components
of
complex
systems
with
the
goal
of
gaining
systems
perspective
to
their
joint
behavior
in
spite
of
recent
progress
there
is
still
much
more
work
to
be
done
in
this
area
even
when
not
trying
to
infer
causal
effects
we
would
ideally
need
flexible
nonparametric
approaches
that
handle
many
observed
time
series
while
accounting
for
unmeasured
variables
and
allowing
for
non-stationarity
however
despite
these
limitations
emerging
data
especially
those
obtained
from
interventions
over
time
and
perturbations
to
the
system’s
state
offer
new
opportunities
for
discovering
causal
effect
of
variables
on
each
other
at
minimum
these
new
data
and
continued
developments
in
this
area
can
help
researchers
take
the
first
step
towards
causal
inference
by
restricting
the
set
of
possible
causal
hypotheses
we
believe
this
area
will
continue
to
be
an
active
area
of
research
