wns
here
attempt
to
give
brief
but
fear
imper
fect
sketch
of
the
progress
of
opinion
on
the
origin
of
species
the
great
majority
of
naturalists
have
believed
that
species
were
immutable
productions
and
have
been
separately
created
this
view
has
been
ably
maintained
by
many
authors
few
naturalists
and
several
who
have
not
particularly
studied
natural
history
believe
on
the
other
hand
that
species
undergo
modification
and
that
the
existing
forms
of
life
have
descended
by
true
gen
eration
from
pre-existing
forms
passing
over
authors
of
the
classical
period
and
likewise
demaillet
and
buffon
with
whose
writings
am
not
familiar
lamarck
was
the
first
man
whose
view
that
species
undergo
change
ex
cited
much
attention
this
justly
celebrated
naturalist
published
his
philosophie
zoologique
in
1809
and
his
in
troduction
to
his
hist
nat
des
animaux
sans
vertébres
in
1815
in
which
works
he
upholds
the
doctrine
that
spe
cies
are
descended
from
each
other
he
seems
to
have
been
chiefly
led
to
this
conclusion
by
the
difficulty
of
dis
tinguishing
species
and
varieties,—by
the
almost
perfect
gradation
of
the
forms
in
certain
groups
and
by
the
anal
ogy
of
domestic
productions
with
respect
to
the
means
of
modification
he
attributed
something
to
the
action
of
vi
preface
external
conditions
something
to
the
crossing
of
already
existing
forms
and
much
to
use
and
disuse
or
the
effects
of
habit
to
this
latter
agency
he
seems
to
attribute
all
the
beautiful
adaptations
in
nature,—such
as
the
long
neck
of
the
giraffe
for
browsing
on
the
branches
of
trees
baut
he
likewise
believed
in
law
of
progressive
develop
ment
and
as
all
the
forms
of
life
thus
tended
to
progress
in
order
to
account
for
the
presence
of
very
simple
pro
ductions
at
the
present
day
he
maintained
that
such
forms
were
now
spontaneously
generated
geoffroy
saint
hilaire
as
is
stated
in
his
life
by
his
son
as
early
as
1795
suspected
that
what
we
call
species
are
various
degenerations
of
the
same
type
it
was
not
until
1828
that
he
published
his
conviction
that
the
same
forms
have
not
been
perpetuated
since
the
origin
of
all
things
geoffroy
seems
to
have
relied
chiefly
on
the
con
ditions
of
life
or
the
monde
ambiant
as
the
cause
of
change
but
he
was
cautious
and
as
his

declares
that
horticultural
experiments
have
established
beyond
the
possibility
of
refutation
that
botanical
species
are
only
higher
and
more
permanent
class
of
varieties
he
extends
the
same
view
to
animals
the
dean
believes
that
single
species
of
each
genus
were
created
in
an
originally
highly
plastic
condition
and
that
these
by
intercrossing
and
by

tion
have
produced
all
our

it

the
anonymous
author
says
the
proposition
determined
on
after
mach
consideration
is
that
the
several
series
of
animated
beings
from
the
simplest
and
oldest
up
to
the
highest
and
most
recent
are
under
the
providence
of
god
the
results
first
of
an
impulse
which
has
been
imparted
to
the
forms
of
life
advancing
them
in
definite
times
by
generation
through
grades
of
organisation
terminating
in
the
highest
dicotyledons
and
vertebrata
these
grades
be
ing
few
in
number
and
generally
marked
by
intervals
of
organic
character
which
we
find
to
be
practical
difficulty
in
ascertaining
affinities
second
of
another
impulse
con
nected
with
the
vital
forces
tending
in
the
course
of
gen
erations
to
modify
organic
structures
in
accordance
with
external
circumstances
as
food
the
nature
of
the
habitat
and
the
meteoric
agencies
these
being
the
adaptations
of
the
natural
theologian
the
author
apparently
be
lieves
that
organisation
progresses
by
sudden
leaps
but
that
the
effects
produced
by
the
conditions
of
life
are
gradual
the
author
argues
with
much
force
on
general
grounds
that
species
are
not
immutable
productions
baut
cannot
see
how
the
two
supposed
impulses
account
in
scientific
sense
for
the
numerous
and
beautiful
co
adaptations
which
we
see
thronghout

cannot

that
we
thus
gain
any
insight

from

it

it

an

it
is

the

be
the

has
been
called
by
one
of
our
grestt::;y

on
my
return
home
it
occurred
to
me
in
1837
that
some
thing
might
perhaps
be
made
out
on
this
question
by
patiently
accumulating
and
reflecting
on
all
sorts
of
facts
which
could
possibly
have
any
bearing
on
it
after
five
years
work
allowed
myself
to
speculate
on
the
subject
and
drew
up
some
short
notes
these
enlarged
in
1844
into
sketch
of
the
conclusions
which
then
seemed
to
me
probable
from
that

for

as

that
have

almost
exactly

who
both
knew

having
read
my

honoured
me
by
thinking
it
advisable
to
publish
with
mr
wallace’s
excellent
memoir
some
brief
extracts
from
my
manuscripts
this
abstract
which
now
publish
must
necessarily
be
imperfect
cannot
here
give

and
author
ities
for
my
several
statements
and
must
trust
to
the
reader
reposing
some
confidence
in
my
accuracy
no
doubt
errors
will
have
crept
in
though
hope
have
always
been
cautious
in
trusting
to
good
authorities
alone
can
here
give
only
the
general
conclusions
at
which
have
arrived
with
few
facts
in
illustration
but
which
hope
in
most
cases
will
suffice
no
one
can
feel
more
sensible
than
do
of
the
necessity
of
hereafter
publishing
in
detail
all
the
facts
with
references
on
which
my
con
clusions
have
been
grounded
and
hope
in
future
work
to
do
this
for
am
well
aware
that
scarcely
single
oint
is
discussed
in
this
volume
on
which
facts
cannot
adduced
often
apparently
leading
to
conclusions
di
rectly
opposite
to
those
at
which
have
arrived
fair
result
can
be
obtained
only
by
fully
stating
and
balancing
the
facts
and
arguments
on
both
sides
of
each
question
and
this
cannot
possibly
be
here
done
much
regret
that
want
of
space
prevents
my
having
the
satisfaction
of
acknowledging
the
generous
assistance
which
have
received
from
very
many
naturalists
some
of
them
personally
unknown
to
me
cannot
however
let
this
opportunity
pass
without
expressing
my
deep
obligations
to
dr
hooker
who
for
the
last
fifteen
years
has
aided
me
in
every
possible
way
by
his
large
stores
of
knowledge
and
his
excellent
judgment
in
considering
the
origin
of
species
it
is
quite
con
ceivable
that
naturalist
reflecting
on
the
mutual
affini
ties
of
organic
beings
on
their
embryological
relations
their
geographical
distribution
geological
succession
and
other
such
facts
might
come
to
the
conclusion
that
each
species
had
not
been
independently
created
but
had
de
introduotion
scended
like
varieties
from
other
species
nevertheless
such
conclusion
even
if
well
founded
would
be
unsat
isfactory
until
it
could
be
shown
how
the
innumerable
species
inhabiting
this
world
have
been
modified
so
as
to
acquire
that
perfection
of
structure
and
coadaptation
which
most
justly
excites
our
admiration
naturalists
continually
refer
to
external
conditions
such
as
climate
food
&c
as
the
only
possible
cause
of
variation
in
one
very
limited
sense
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
this
may
be
true
but
it
is
preposterous
to
attribute
to
mere
external
conditions
the
structure
for
instance
of
the
woodpecker
with
its
feet
tail
beak
and
tongue
so
admirably
adapted
to
catch
insects
under
the
bark
of
trees
in
the
case
of
the
misseltoe
which
draws
its
nourishment
from
certain
trees
which
has
seeds
that
must
be
transported
by
certain
birds
and
which
has
flowers
with
separate
sexes
abso
lute}{orequiring
the
agency
of
certain
insects
to
bring
pol
len
from
one
flower
to
the
other
it
is
equally
preposterous
to
account
for
the
structure
of
this
parasite
with
its
rela
tions
to
several
distinct
organic
beings
by
the
effects
of
external
conditions
or
of
e:bit
or
of
the
volition
of
the
plant
itself
it
is
therefore
of
the
hi%hest
importance
to
gain
clear
insight
into
the
means
of
modification
and
coadapta
tion
at
the
commencement
of
my
observations
it
seemed
to
me
probable
that
careful
study
of
domesticated
ani
mals
and
of
cultivated
plants
would
offer
the
best
chance
of
making
out
this
obscure
problem
nor
have
been
disappointed
in
this
and
in
all
other
perplexing
cases
have
invariably
found
that
our
knowledge
imperfect
though
it
be
of
variation
under
domestication
afforded
the
best
and
safest
clue
may
venture
to
express
my
conviction
of
the
high
value
of
such
studies
although
they
have
been
very
commonly
neglected
by
naturalists
from
these
considerations
shall
devote
the
first
chapter
of
this
abstract
to
variation
under
domestica
tion
we
shall
thus
see
that
large
amount
of
hereditary
modification
is
at
least
possible
and
what
is
equally
or
more
important
we
shall
see
how
great
is
the
power
of

in

variations
will
then
pass
on
to
the
variability
of
species
in
state
of

but
shall
unfortunately
be
compelled
to
treat
this
subject
far
too
briefly
as
it
can
be
treated
pro
erlgr
only
by
giving
long
catalogues
of
facts
we
shnfl
owever
be
enabled
to
discuss
what
circumstances
are
most
favourable
to
variation
in
the
next
chapter
the
struggle
for
existence
amonggt
all
or
nic
beings
throughout
the
world
which
inevitably
fol
ows
from
their
higi
geometrical
powers
of
increase
will
be
treated
of
this
is
the
doctrine
of
malthus
applied
to
the
whole
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
many
more
individuals
of
each
species
are
born
than
can
pos
sibly
survive
and
as
consequently
there
is
frequently
recurring
struggle
for
existence
it
follows
that
any
being
if
it
vary
however
slightly
in
apy
manner
profitable
to
itself
under
the
complex
and
sometimes
varying
con
ditions

thus
be
naturally
selected
from
the
strong
principle
of

any
selected
variety
will
tend
to
propagate
its
new
and
modifted
form
this
fandamental
subject
of
natural
selection
will
be
treated
at
some
lengf_h
in
the
fourth
chapter
and
we
shall
then
see
how
natural
selection
almost
inevitably
causes
much
extinction
of
the
less
improved
forms
of
life
and
induces
what
have
called
divergence
of
character
in
the
next
chapter
shall
discuss
the
complex
and
little
known
laws
of
variation
and
of
correlation
of
growth
in
the
four
succeeding
chapters
the
most
apparent
and
gravest
difficulties
on
the
theory
will
be
given
namely
rst
the
difficulties
of

in

chapter
shall
give
brief
recapitulation
of
the
whole
work
and
few
con
cluding
remarks
no
one
ought
to
feel
surprise
at
much
remaining
as
yet
unexplained
in
regard
to
the
origin
of
species
and
varieties
if
he
makes
due
allowance
for
our
profound
ignorance
in
regard
to
the
mutual
relations
of
all
the
beings
which
live
around
us
who
can
explain
why
one
species
ranges
widely
and
is
very
numerous
and
why
another
allied
species
has
narrow
range
and
is
rare
yet
these
relations
are
of
the
highest
importance
for
they
determine
the
present
welfare
and
as
believe
the
future
success
and
modification
of
every
inhabitant
of
this
world
still
less
do
we
know
of
the
mutual
relations
of
the
in
numerable
inhabitants
of
the
world
during
the
many
past
geological
hs
in
its
history
although
much
remains
obscure
and
will
long
remnain
obscure
can
entertain
no
doubt
after
the
most
deliberate
study
and
dispassionate
judgment
of
which
am
capable
that
the
view
which
most
naturalists
entertain
and
which
formerly
enter
tained—namely
that
each
species
has
been
independently
created—is
erroneous
am
fully
convinced
that
species
are
not
immutable
but
that
those
belonging
to
what
are
called
the
same
era
are
lineal
descendants
of
some
other
and
generally
extinct
species
in
the
same
manner
as
the
acknowledged
varieties
of
any
one
species
are
the
descendants
of
that
species
furthermore
am
convinced
that
natural
selection
has
been
the
main
but
not

sive

waen

variety
or

of
our
older
cultivated
plants
and

one
of
the
first
points
which
strikes
us
is
that
they
gen
erally
differ
much
more
from
each
other
than
do
the
in
dividuals
of
any
one
species
or
variety
in
state
of
nature
when
we
reflect
on
tﬂe
vast
diversity
of
the
plants
and
animals
which
have
been
cultivated
and
which
have
varied
during
all
ages
under
the
most
different
climates
and
treatment
think
we
are
driven
to
conclude
that
this
greater
variability
is
simply
due
to
our
domestic
produc
tions
having
been
raised
under
conditions
of
life
not
so
uniform
as
and
somewhat
different
from
those
to
which
the
parent-species
have
been
exposed
under
nature
there
is
also
think
some
probability
in
the
view
pro
pounded
by
andrew
knight
that
this
variability
may
be
partly
connected
with
excess
of
food
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
organic
beings
must
be
exposed
during
several
generations
to
the
new
conditions
of
life
to
cause
any
ap
reciable
amount
of
variation
and
that
when
the
organ
1sation
has
once
begun
to
vary
it
generally
continues
to
vary
for
many
generations
no
case
is
on
record
of
variable
being
ceasing
to
be
variable
under
cultivation
our
oldest
cultivated
plants
such
as
wheat
still
often
yield
new
varieties
our
oldest
domesticated
animals
are
still
capable
of
rapid
improvement

it
has
been
disputed
at
what
period
of
life
the
causes
of
variability
whatever
they
may
be
genenlly
act
whether
during
the
early
or
late
period
of
development
of
the
embryo
or
at
the
mstant
of
conception
geoffroy
st
hilaire’s
experiments
show
that
unnatural
treatment
of
the
embryo
causes
monstrosities
and
monstrosities
cannot
be
separated
by
any
clear
line
of
distinction
from
mere
variations
but
am
strongly
inclined
to
suspect
that
the
most
frequent
cause
of
variability
may
be
attrib
uted
to
the
male
and
female
reproductive
elements
havin
been
affected
prior
to
the
act
of
conception
seve
reasons
make
me
believe
in
this
but
the
chief
one
is
the
remarkable
effect
which
confinement
or
cultivation
has
on
the
functions
of
the
reproductive
system
this
system
appearing
to
be
far
more
susceptible
than
any
other
part
of
the
organisation
to
the
action
of
any
change
in
the
conditions
of
life
nothing
is
more
easy
than
to
tame
an
animal
and
few
things
more
difficult
than
to
get
it
to
breed
freely
under
confinement
even
in
the
many
cases
when
the
male
and
female
unite
ilow
many
animals
there
are
which
will
not
breed
though
living
long
under
not

this
is

attributed
to

some

has
een
found
out
that
very
trifling
changes
such
as
little
more
or
less

at
some

period
of

will
determine
whether
or
not
the

cannot
here
enter
on
the
copious
details
which
have
col
lected
on
this
curious
subject
but
to
show
how
singular
the
laws
are
which
determine
the
reproduction
of
animals
under
confinement
may
just
mention
that
carnivorous
animals
even
from
the
tropics
breed
in
this
country
pre
freely
under
cofinement
with
the
exception
of
the
planti

or
bear
family
whereas
carnivorous
birds
with
the
rarest
exceptions
hardly
ever
lay
fertile
eggs
many
exotic
plants
have
pollen
utterly
worthless
in
the
same
exact
condition
as
in
the
most
sterile
hybrids

and
sickly

variation
cmar
under
confinement
and
when
on
the
other
hand
we
see
individuals
thonfh
taken
young
from
state
of
nature
perfectly
tamed
long-lived
and
healthy
of
which
could
give
numerous
instances
yet
having
their
reproductive
system
go
seriously
aﬂ'ecteg
by
unperceived
causes
as
to
fail
in
acting
we
need
not
be
surprised
at
this
system
when
it
does
act
under
confinement
acting
not
quite
reg
ularly
and
producing
offspring
not
perfectly
like
their
parents
or
variable
sterility
has
been
said
to
be
the
bane
of
horticulture
but
on
this
view
we
owe
variability
to
the
same
cause
which
produces
sterility
and
variability
is
the
source
of
all
the
choicest
productions
of
the
garden
may
add
that
as
some
organisms
will
breed
most
freely
under
the
most
unnatural
conditions
for
instance
the
rabbit
and
ferret
kept
in
hutches
showing
that
their
reproductive
system
has
not
been
thus
affected
so
will
some
animals
and
plants
withstand
domestication
or
cultivation
and
vary
very
slightly—perhaps
hardly
more
than
in
state
of
nature
long
list
could
easily
be
given
of
ortin
plants
;
by
this
term
gardeners
mean
single
bud
or
offset
which
suddenly
assumes
new
and
sometimes
very
different
character
from
that
of
the
rest
of
the
plant
such
buds
can
be
propagated
by
grafting
&c
and
sometimes
by
seed
ese
gports”are
extremely
rare
under
nature
but
far
from
rare
under
cultivation
and
in
this
case
we
see
that
the
treatment
of
the
parent
has
affected
bud
or
offset
and
not
the
ovules
or
pollen
but
it
is
the
opinion
of
most
physiologists
that
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
bud
and
an
ovule
in
their
earliest
stages
of
for
mation
so
that
in
fact
sports
support
my
view
that
variability
may
be
largely
attributed
to
the
ovules
or
pol
len
or
to
both
having
been
affected
by
the
treatment
of
the
parent
prior
to
gm
act
of
conception
these
cases
anyhow
show
that
variation
is
not
necessarily
connected
as
some
authors
have
supposed
with
the
act
of
gen
eadlings
from
the
samo
fruit
and
the
th
the
same
fruit
and
the
young
of
the
same
litter
sometimes
differ
considerably
from
each
other
cmar
l
under
domestication
17
though
both
the
young
and
the
parents
as
miiller
has
re
marked
have
apparently
been
exposed
to
exactly
the
same
conditions
of
life
and
this
shows
how
unimportant
the
direct
effects
of
the
conditions
of
life
are
in
comparison
with
the
laws
of
reproduction
and
of
growth
and
of
in
heritance
for
had
the
action
of
the
conditions
been
di
rect
if
any
of
the
young
had
varied
all
would
probably
have
varied
in
the
same
manner
to
judge
how
much
in
the
case
of
any
variation
we
should
attribute
to
the
direct
action
of
heat
moisture
light
food
&c
is
most
difficult
my
impression
is
that
with
animals
such
agen
cies
have
produced
very
little
direct
effect
thongh
ap
parent]l&rmore
in
the
case
of
plants
under
this
point
of
view
mr
buckman’s
recent
experiments
on
plants
seem
extremely
valuable
when
all
or
nearly
all
the
individ
uals
ed
to
certain
conditions
are
aftected
in
the
same
way
the
change
at
first
appears
to
be
directly
due
to
such
conditions
but
in
some
cases
it
can
be
shown
that
quite
ogyosite
conditions
produce
similar
changes
of
struc
ture
nevertheless
some
slight
amount
of
change
way
think
be
attributed
to
the
direct
action
of
the
conditions
of
life—as
in
some
cases
increased
size
from
amount
of
food
colour
from
particular
kinds
of
food
and
from
light
and
perhaps
the
thickness
of
fur
from
climate
abit
also
has
decided
influence
as
in
the
period
of
flowering
with
plants
when
transported
from
one
climate
to
another
in
animals
it
has
more
marked
effect
for
instance
find
in
the
domestic
duck
that
the
bones
of
the
wing
weigh
less
and
the
bones
of
the
leg
more
in
propor
tion
to
the
whole
skeleton
than
do
the
same
bones
in
the
wild
duck
and
presume
that
this
change
may
be
safely
attributed
to
the
domestic
duck
flying
much
less
and
walking
more
than
its
wild
garent
fhe
great
and
in
herited
development
of
the
udders
in
cows
and
goats
in
countrjes
where
they
are
habitually
milked
in
comparison
with
the
state
of
these
organs
in
otker
countries
is
another
instance
of
the
effect
of
use
not
single
domestic
ani
mal
can
be
named
which
has
not

some
country

and
the
view
suggested
by
some
authors
that
the
drooping
is
due
to
the
disuse

from
the

not
being

there
are

some
few
of
which
can
be
dimly

mentioned
will
here
only
allude
to
what
may
be
called
correlation
of
growth
any
chanﬁe
in
the
embryo
or
larva
will
almost
certainly
entail
changes
in
the
mature
animal
in
monstrosities
the
correlations
between
quite
distinet
parts
are
very
curious
and
many
instances
are
given
inf.‘[sidore
geoffroy
st
hilaire’s
great
work
on
this
subject
breeders
believe
that
long
limbs
are
almost
always
accompanied
by
an
elongated
head
some
in
stances
of
correlation
are
quite
whimsical
thus
cats
with
blue
eyes
are
invariably
deaf
colour
and
constitutional
peculiarities
go
together
of
which
many
remarkable
cases
could
be
given
amongst
animals
and
plants
from
the
facts
collected
by
heusinger
it
appears
that
white
shee
and
pigs
are
differently
affected
from
coloured
individuals
by
certain
vegetable
poisons
hairless
dogs
have
imper
fect
teeth
long-haired
and
coarse-haired
animals
are
apt
to
have
as
is
asserted
long
or
many
horns
pigeons
with
feathered
feet
have
skin
between
their
outer
toes
pigeons
with
short
beaks
have
small
feet
and
those
with
lon
beaks
large
feet
hence
if
man
goes
on
selecting
an
thus
augmenting
any
peculiarity
he
will
almost
certainly
unconsciously
modify
other
parts
of
the
structure
owing
to
the
mysterious
laws
of
the
correlation
of
growth
the
result
of
the
various
quite
unknown
or
diml
seen
laws
of
variation
is
infinitely
complex
and
diversi
fied
it
is
well
worth
while
carefully
to
study
the
several
treatises
published
on
some
of
our
old
cultivated
plants
as
on
the
hyacinth
potato
even
the
dahlia
&c
and
it
is
really
surprising
to
note
the
endless
points
in
structure
and
constitution
in
which
the
varieties

subvarieties
differ
sliihtly
from

the
whole

to
have
become
plastic
and

to
depart
in
some
small
degree
from
that
of
the
parental
type

lucas’s
treatise
in

large
volumes

the

and
the
best
on
this
subject
no
breeder
doubts
how
strong
is
the
tendency
to
inheritance
like
produces
like
is
his
fandamental
belief
doubts
have
been
thrown
on
this
princi})le
by
theoretical
writers
alone
when
any
devia
tion
of
structure
often
apﬁears
and
we
see
it
in
the
father
and
child
we
cannot
tell
whether
it
may
not
be
due
to
the
same
cause
having
acted
on
both
but
when
amongst
individuals
apparently
exposed
to
the
same
conditions
any
very
rare
deviation
due
to
some
extraordinary
com
bination
of
circumstances
appears
in
the
parent—say
once
amongst
several
million
in
viduals—amf
it
reappears
in
the
child
the
mere
doctrine
of
chances
almost
compels
us
to
attribute
its
reappearance
to
inheritance
every
one
must
have
heard
of
cases
of
albinism
prickly
skin
hairy
bodies
&c
appearing
in
several
members
of
the
same
fami
ly
if
strange
and
rare
deviations
of
structure
are
truly
inherited
less
strange
and
commoner
deviations
may
be
freely
admitted
to
ﬁe
inheritable
perhaps
the
correct
way
of
viewing
the
whole
subject
would
be
to
look
at
the
inheritance
of
every
character
whatever
as
the
rule
and
non-inheritance
as
the
anomaly
the
laws
governing
inheritance
are
quite
unknown
no
one
can
say
why
the
same
peculiarity
in
different
indi
viduals
of
the
same
species
and
in
individuals
of
different
species
is
sometimes
inherited
and
sometimes
not
so
why
the
child
often
reverts
in
certain
characters
to
its
grandfather
or
grandmother
or
other
much
more
remote
ancestor
why
peculiarity
is
often
transmitted
from
one
sex
to
both
sexes
or
to
one
sex
alone
more
commonly
but
not
exclusively
to
the
like
sex
it
is
fact
of
some
little
importance
to
us
tha;:dpeculiarities
appearing
in
the
males
of
our
domestic
breeds
are
often
transmitted
either
ex
clusivelﬁ
or
in
much
greater
degree
to
males
alone
much
more
important
rule
which
think
may
be
trusted
is
that
at
whatever
period
of
life
peculiarity
first
appears
it
tends
to
appear
in
the
offspring
at
correspond
ing
age
though
sometimes
earlier
in
many
cases
this
could
not
be
otherwise
thus
the
inherited
peculiarities
in

variation
crar
the
horns
of
cattle
could
appear
only
in
the
offspring
when
nearly
mature
peculiarities
in
the
silkworm
are
known
to
apeear
at
the
corresponding
caterpillar
or
cocoon
stage
but
hereditary
diseases
and
some
other
facts
make
me
believe
that
the
rule
has
wider
extension
and
that
when
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
peculiarity
should
appear
at
any
particular
age
yet
that
it
does
tend
to
appear
in
the
offspring
at
the
same
period
at
which
it
first
appeared
in
the
parent
believe
this
rule
to
be
of
the
highest
importance
in
explaining
the
laws
of
embryology
fhese
remarks
are
of
course
confined
to
the
first
appearance
of
the
peculiarity
and
not
to
its
primary
cause
which
may
have
acted
on
the
ovules
or
male
element
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
in
the
crossed
offspring
from
short
horned
cow
by
long-horned
bull
the
greater
length
of
horn
though
appearing
late
in
life
is
clearly
due
to
the
male
element
having
alluded
to
the
subject
of
reversion
may
here
refer
to
statement
often
made
by
naturalists—namely
that
our
domestic
varieties
when
run
wild
gradually
but
certainly
revert
in
character
to
their
aboriginal
stocks
hence
it
has
been
argued
that
no
deductions
can
be
drawn
from
domestic
races
to
species
in
state
of
nature
have
in
vain
endeavoured
to
discover
on
what
decisive
facts
the
above
statement
has
often
and
so
boldly
been
made
there
would
be
great
difficulty
in
proving
its
truth
we
may
safely
conclude
that
very
many
of
the
most
strongly
marked
domestic
varieties
could
not
possibly
live
in
wild
state
in
many
cases
we
do
not
know
what
the
ab
original
stock
was
and
so
could
not
tell
whether
or
not
nearly
perfect
reversion
had
ensued
it
would
be
quite
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
the
effects
of
intercrossing
that
only
single
variety
should
be
turned
loose
in
its
new
home
nevertheless
as
our
varieties
certainly
do
occasionally
revert
in
some
of
their
characters
to
ancestral
forms
it
seems
to
me
not
improbable
that
if
we
could
succeed
in
naturalising
or
were
to
cultivate
during
many
enerations
the
several
races
for
instance
of
the
cabbage
in
very
poor
soil
in
which
case
however
some
effect
would
have
to
be
attributed
to
the
direct
action
of
the
omar
l}
under
domestiocation
poor
soil
that
they
would
to
extent
or
even
wholly
rzevert
to
t.hz
wild
aboriginn,irsgt.;)ck
whether
or
not
tge
experiment
would
succeed
is
not
of
great
impor
tance
for
our
line
of
ent
for
by
the
experiment
itself
the
conditions
of
life
are
changed
if
it
could
be
shown
that
our
domestic
varieties
manifested
strong
tendency
to
reversion,—that
is
to
lose
their
acquired
characters
whilst
kept
under
unchanged
conditions
and
whilst
kept
in
considerable
body
so
that
free
intercross
ing
might
check
by
blending
together
any
slight
devia
tions
of
structure
in
such
case
grant
that
we
could
deduce
nothing
from
domestic
varieties
in
regard
to
species
but
there
is
not
shadow
of
evidence
in
favour
of
this
view
to
assert
that
we
could
not
breed
our
cart
and
race-horses
long
and
short-horned
cattle
and
poultry
of
various
breeds
and
esculent
vegetables
for
an
almost
infinite
number
of
generations
would
be
opposed
to
ali
experience
may
add
that
when
under
nature
the
con
ditions
of
life
do
change
variations
and
reversions
of
char
acter
probably
do
occur
but
natural
selection
as
will
hereaffer
be
explained
will
determine
how
far
the
new
characters
thus
arising
shall
be
preserved
when
we
look
to
the
hereditary
varieties
or
races
of
our
domestic
animals
and
plants
and
compare
them
with
specics
closely
allied
together
we
generally
perceive
in
each
domestic
race
as
already
remarked
less
uniformity
of
character
than
in
true
species
domestic
races
of
the
same
species
also
often
have
somewhat
monstrous
char
acter
by
which
mean
that
although
differing
from
each
other
and
from
the
other
species
of
the
same
genus
in
several
trifling
respects
they
often
differ
in
an
extreme
degree
in
some
one
part
both
when
compared
one
with
another
and
more
especially
when
compared
with
all
the
species
in
nature
to
which
tﬂey
are
nearest
allied
with
these
exceptions
and
with
that
of
the
perfect
fertility
of
varieties
when
crossed,—a
subject
hereafter
to
be
dis
cussed
domestic
races
of
the
same
species
differ
from
each
other
in
the
same
manner
as
only
in
most
cases
in
tesser
degree
than
do
closely-allied
species
of
the
same
genus
in
state
of
nature
think
this
must
be
admitted

variation
omar
when
we
find
that
there
are
hardly
any
domestic
races
either
amongst
animals
or
plants
which
have
not
been
ranked
by
some
competent
judges
as
mere
varieties
and
by
other
competent
judges
as
the
descendants
of
aborigi
nally
distinet
species
any
marked
distinction
existed
between
domestic
races
and
species
this
source
of
doubt
could
not
so
perpetually
recur
it
has
often
been
stated
that
domestic
races
do
not
differ
from
each
other
in
char
acters
of
generic
value
think
it
could
be
shown
that
this
statement
is
hardly
correct
but
naturalists
differ
most
widely
in
determining
what
characters
are
of
generic
value
all
such
valuations
being
at
present
empirical
moreover
on
the
view
of
the
oriﬁin
of
genera
which
shall
presently
give
we
have
no
right
to
expect
often
to
meet
with
generic
differences
in
our
domesticated
productions
wieu
we
attempt
to
estimate
the
amount
of
structural
difference
between
the
domestic
races
of
the
same
species
we
are
soon
involved
in
doubt
from
not
knowing
whether
they
have
descended
from
one
or
several
parent-species
this
point
if
it
could
be
cleared
up
would
be
interesting
if
for
instance
it
could
be
shown
that
the
greyhound
bloodhound
terrier
spaniel
and
bull-dog
which
we
all
know
propagate
their
kind
so
truly
were
the
offspring
of
any
single
species
then
such
facts
would
have
great
weight
in
making
us
doubt
about
the
immutability
of
the
many
very
close%y
allied
natural
species—for
instance
of
the
many
foxes—inhabiting
different
quarters
of
the
world
do
not
believe
as
we
shall
presently
see
that
the
whole
amount
of
difference
between
the
several
breeds
of
the
dog
has
been
produced
under
domestication
believe
that
some
small
art
of
the
difference
is
due
to
their
being
descended
from
istinct
species
in
the
case
of
some
other
domesticated
species
there
is
presumptive
or
even
strong
evidence
that
all
the
breeds
have
descended
from
single
wild
stock
it
has
often
been
assumed
that
man
has
chosen
for
dowmestication
animals
and
plants
having
an
extraordi
nary
inherent
tendency
to
vary
and
likewise
to
withstand
diverse
climates
do
not
dispute
that
these
capacities
have
added
largely
to
the
value
of
most
of
our
domesti
cated
productions
but
how
could
savage
possibly
know
when
he
first
tamed
an
animal
whether
1t
would
omar
l
under
domestioation
23
vary
in
sa
nerations
and
whether
it
would
e;f?l;re
omm;gf
has
the
little
variability
of
the
ass
or
guinea-fowl
or
the
small
power
of
endurance
of
warmth
by
the
rein-deer
or
of
cold
by
the
common
camel
prevented
their
domesticationf
cannot
doubt
that
if
other
animals
and
plants
equal
in
number
to
our
domes
ticated
productions
and
belonging
to
equally
diverse
classes
and
countries
were
taken
from
state
of
nature
and
could
be
made
to
breed
for
an
equal
number
of
gen
erations
under
domestication
they
would
vary
on
an
average
as
largely
as
the
parent
species
of
our
existing
domesticated
productions
have
varied
in
the
case
of
most
of
our
anciently
domesticated
ani
mals
and
plants
do
not
think
it
is
possible
to
come
to
any
definite
conclusion
whether
they
have
descended
from
one
or
several
species
the
argument
mainly
relied
on
by
those
who
believe
in
the
multiple
origin
of
our
do
mesticated
animals
is
that
we
find
in
the
most
ancient
records
more
especially
on
the
monuments
of
egypt
much
diversity
in
the
breeds
and
that
some
of
the
breeds
closely
resemble
perhaps
are
identical
with
those
still
existing
even
if
thislatter
fact
were
found
more
strictly
and
generally
true
than
seems
to
me
to
be
the
case
what
does
it
show
but
that
some
of
our
breeds
originated
there
four
or
five
thousand
years
ago
after
the
recent
discov
eries
of
flint
tools
or
celts
in
the
superficial
deposits
of
france
and
england
few
geologists
will
doubt
that
man
in
suﬁicientfy
civilized
state
to
have
manufactured
weapons
existed
at
period
extremely
remote
as
measured
by
years
and
we
know
that
at
the
present
day
there
is
hardly
any
tribe
so
barbarian
as
not
to
have
domesticated
at
least
the
dog
the
whole
subject
must
think
remain
vague
nev
ertheless
may
without
here
entering
on
any
details
state
that
from
geograghical
and
other
considerations
think
it
highly
probable
that
our
domestic
dogs
have
descended
from
several
wild
species
knowing
as
we
do
that
savages
are
very
fond
of
taming
animals
it
seems
to
me
unlikely
in
the
case
of
the
dog-genus
which
is
distributed
in
wild
state
throughout
the
world
that
since
man
first
appeared
one

in

can
form
no

from
facts
communicated
to
me
by
mr
blyth
on
the
habits

and
constitution
&c
of
the
humped
indian
cattle
that
these
had
descended
from
different
aboriginal
stock
from
our
european

and
several
com%etent
judges
believe
that
these
latter
have
had
more
than
one
wild
parent
with
resf)ect
to
horses
from
reasons
which
cannot
give
here
am
doubtfully
inclined
to
believe
in
opposition
to
several
authors
that
all
the

have
de
scended
from

mr
blyth
whose
opinion
from
his
large
and
varied
stores
of
knowledge
should
value
more
than
that
of
almost
any
one
thinks
that
all
the
breeds
of
poultry
have
proceeded
from
the
common
wild
indian
fowl
gallus
bankiva
in
regard
to
ducks
and
rabbits
the
breeds
of
which
differ
considerably
from
each
other
in
structure
do
not
doubt
that
they
all
have
descended
from
the
common
wild
duck
and
rabbit
the
doctrine
of
the
origin
of
our
several
domestic
races
from
several
aboriginal
stocks
has
been
carried
to
an
absurd
extreme
by
some
authors
they
believe
that
every
race
which
breeds
true
let
the
distinctive
characters
be
ever
so
slight
has
had
its
wild
prototype
at
this
rate
there
must
have
existed
at
least
score
of
species
of
wild
cattle
as
many
sheep
and
several
goats
in
europe
alone
and
several
even
within
great
britain
one
author
believes
that
there
formerly
existed
in
great
britain
eleven
wild
ecies
of
sheep
peculiar
to
it
when
we
bear
in
mind
that
britain
has
now
hardly
one
peculiar
mammal
and
france
but
few
distinct
from
those
of
ger
many
and
conversely
and
so
with
hungary
spain
&e
but
that
each
of
these
kingdoms
possesses
several
pecu
liar
breeds
of
cattle
sheep
&c
we
must
admit
that
many
domestic
breeds
have
originated
in
europe
for
whence
could
they
have
been
derived
as
these
several
countries
do
not
possess
number
of
peculiar
species
as
distinct
ga.rent—stocks
so
it
is
in

evenin
the
case
of
the
omestic
dogs
of
the
whole

which
fully
admit
have
probably
descended
from
several
wild
species
can
not
doubt
that
there
has
been
an
immense
amount
of
in
herited
variation
who
can
believe
that
animals
closely
cmar
l
under
domestication
resembling
the
italian
greyhound
the
bloodhound
the
bull-dog
or
blenheim
spaniel
&c.—so
unlike
all
wild
canidee—ever
existed
freely
in
state
of
nature
it
has
often
been
loosely
said
that
all
our
races
of
dogs
have
been
groduced
by
the
crossing
of
few
aboriginal
species
but
crossing
we
can
get
only
forms
in
some
degree
inter
mediate
between
their
parents
and
if
we
account
for
our
several
domestic
races
by
this
process
we
must
admit
the
former
existence
of
the
most
extreme
forms
as
the
italian
greyhound
bloodhound
bull-dog
&ec
in
the
wild
state
i;oreover
the
possibility
of
making
distinct
races
by
crossing
has
been
greatly
exaggerated
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
race
may
be
modified
by
occasional
crosses
if
aided
by
the
careful
selection
of
those
individual
mongrels
which
present
any
desired
character
but
that
race
could
be
obtained
nearly
intermediate
between
two
extremely
different
races
or
species
can
hardly
believe
sir
j
sebright
expressly
experimentised
for
this
object
and
failed
the
offspring
from
the
first

between
two
pure
breeds
is
tolerably
and
sometimes
as
have
fou.u(f
with

extremely
uniform
and
everything
seems
simple
enough
but
when
these
mongrels
are
cross
ed
one
with
another
for
several
generations
hardly
two
of
them
will
be
alike
and
then
the
extreme
difficulty
or
rather
utter
hopelessness
of
the
task
becomes
apparent
certainly
breed
intermediate
between

very
distinct

as
he
might
have
called
them
could
be

him
great
as
the
differences
are
between
the
breeds
of
pigeons
am
fully
convinced
that
the
common
opinion
of
naturalists
is
correct
namely
that
all
have
descended
from
the
rock-pigeon
columba
livia
including
under
this
term
several
geographical
races
or
sub-species
which
differ
from
each
other
in
the
most
trifling
respects
as
several
of
the
reasons
which
have
led
me
to
this
belief
are
in
some
degree
applicable
in
other
cases
will
here
briefly
give
them
if
the
several
breeds
are
not
varieties
and
28
domestic
pigeons
{cmar
have
not
proceeded
from
the
rock—piieon
they
must
have
dez;cendetlj
from
at
least
seven
or
eight
aboriginal
stocks
for
it
is
impossible
to
make
the
present
domestic
breeds
by
the
crossing
of
any
lesser
number
how
for
instance
could
ﬁ)outer
be
produced
by
crossing
two
breeds
unless
one
of
the
parent-stocks
possessed
the
characteristic
enor
mous
crop
the
supposed
aboriginal
stocks
must
all
have
been
rock-pigeons
that
is
not
breeding
or
willingly
perching
on
trees
but
besides
c
livia
with
its
geo
graphical
sub-species
only
two
or
three
of
the
species
of
rock-pigeons
are
known
and
these
have
not
any
of
the
characters
of
the
domestic
breeds
hence
the
supposed
aboriginal
stocks
must
either
still
exist
in
the
countries
where
they
were
originally
domesticated
and
yet
be
un
known
to
ornithologists
and
this
considering
their
size
habits
and
remarkable
characters
seems
very
improba
ble
or
they
must
have
become
extinct
in
the
wild
state
but
birds
breeding
on
precipices
and
good
fliers
are
un
likely
to
be
exterminated
and
the
common
rock-pigeon
whici
has
the
same
habits
with
the
domestic
breeds
has
not
been
exterminated
even
on
several
of
the
smaller
british
islets
or
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
hence
the
supposed
extermination
of
so
many
species
having
similar
habits
with
the
rock-pigeon
seems
to
me
very
rash
assumption
moreover
the
several
above
named
domesticated
breeds
have
been
transported
to
all
arts
of
the
world
and
therefore
some
of
them
must
eave
been
carried
back
again
into
their
native
countx;i
but
not
one
has
ever
become
wild
or
feral
though
the
dovecot-pigeon
which
is
the
rock-pigeon
in
very
slightly
altered
state
has
become
feral
in
several
places
again
all
recent
experience
shows
that
it
is
most
difficult
to
get
any
wild
animal
to
breed
freely
under
domestication
yet
on
the
hypothesis
of
the
multiple
origin
of
our
pigeons
1t
must
be
assumed
that
at
least
seven
or
eight
species
were
80
thoroughly
domesticated
in
ancient
times
by
half
civilized
man
as
to
be
quite
prolific
under
confinement
an
argument
as
it
seems
to
me
of
great
weight
and
applicable
in
several
other
cases
is
that
the
above-speci
ﬁeg
breeds
though
agreeing
generally
in
constitution
habits
voice
colouring
and
in
most
parts
of
their
struc
cmar
l
domestic
pigeons
29
ture
with
the
wild
rock-pigeon
yet
are
certainly
highl
abnormal
in
other
parts
of
their
structure
we
may
qoolvc
in
vain
throughout
the
whole
great
family
of
columbida
for
beak
like
that
of
the
english
carrier
or
that
of
the
short-faced
tumbler
or
barb
for
reversed
feathers
liko
those
of
the
jacobin
for
crop
like
that
of
the
pouter
for
tail-feathers
like
those
of
the
fantail
hence
1t
must
be
assumed
not
only
that
half-civilized
man
succeeded
in
thoroughly
domesticating
several
species
but
that
he
in
tentionally
or
by
chance
picked
out
extraordinarily
ab
normal
species
and
further
that
these
very
species
have
since
all
become
extinct
or
unknown
so
many
stran
contingencies
seem
to
me
improbable
in
the
highest
de
ee
some
facts
in
regard
to
the
colouring
of
pigeons
well
deserve
consideration

of

if

domestio
pigeons
{omar
the
domestic
breeds
have
descended
from
the
rock-pigeon
but
if
we
deny
this
we
must
make
one
of
the
two
follow
ing
highly
improbable
suppositions
either
firstly
that
allgthe
several
imagined
aboriginal
stocks
were
coloured
and
marked
like
the
rock-pigeon
although
mo
other
ex
isting
species
is
thus
coloured
and
marked
so
that
in
each
separate
breed
there
might
be
tendency
to
revert
to
the
very
same
colours
and
markings
or
secondly
that
each
breed
even
the
purest
has
within
dozen
or
at
most
within
score
o}
generations
been
crossed
by
the
rock
pigeon
say
within
dozen
or
twenty
§enerations
for
we
know
of
no
fact
countenancing
the
belief
that
the
child
ever
reverts
to
some
one
ancestor
removed
by
greater
number
of
generations
in
breed
which
has
een
crossed
only
once
with
some
distinct
breed
the
ten
dency
to
reversion
to
any
character
derived
from
such
cross
will
naturally
become
less
and
less
as
in
each
suc
ceeding
generation
there
will
be
less
of
the
foreign
blood
but
when
there
has
been
no
cross
with
distinct
breed
and
there
is
tendency
in
both
parents
to
revert
to
character
which
has
been
lost
during
some
former
gener
ation
this
tendency
for
all
that
we
can
see
to
the
con
trary
may
be
transmitted
undiminished
for
an
indefinite
number
of
generations
these
two
distinct
cases
are
often
confounded
in
treatises
on
inheritance
lastly
the
hybrids
or
mongrels
from
between
all
the
domestic
breeds
of
pigeons
are
perfectly
fertile
can
state
this
from
my
own
observations
purposely
made
on
the
most
distinct
breeds
now
it
is
difficult
perhaps
im
possible
to
bring
forward
one
case
of
the
hybrid
offspring
of
two
animals
iaa/rl'y
distinet
being
themselves
perfectly
fertile
some
authors
believe
that
ong—continueg
domes
tication
eliminates
this
strong
tendency
to
sterility
from
the
history
of
the
dog
think
there
is
some
roba{ility
in
this
hypothesis
if
applied
to
species
closely
related
to
%ether
though
it
is
unsuglported
by
single
experiment
ut
to
extend
the
hypothesis
so
far
as
to
suppose
that
species
aboriginally
as
distinct
as
carriers
tumblers
outers
and
fantails
now
are
should
yield
offspring

from
these
several
reasons
namely
the
improbability
of
man
having
formeex:g
got
seven
or
eight
sup
cies
of
pigeons
to
breed
freely
under
domestication
these
supposed
species
being
quite
unknown
in
wild
state
and
their
becoming
nowhere
feral
these
species
havi
veg
abnormal
characters
in
certain
respects
as
comp
with
all
other
columbidee
though
so
like
in
most
other
respects
to
the
rock-pigeon
the
blue
colour
and
various
marks
occasionally
appearing
in
all
the
breeds
both
when
kept
pure
and
when
crossed
the
mongrel
offspring
being
perfectly
fertile
from
these
several
reasons
taken
to
ther
can
feel
no
doubt
that
all
our
domestic
breeds
ﬁive
descended
from
the
columba
livia
with
its
geograph
ical
sub-species
in
favour
of
this
view
may
add
firstly
that
c
livia
or
the
rock-pigeon
has
been
found
capable
of
domestica
tion
in
europe
and
in
india
and
that
it
agrees
in
habits
and
in
ireat
number
of
points
of
structure
with
all
the
domestic
breeds
secondly
although
an
english
carrier
or
short-faced
tumbler
differs
immensely
in
certain
char
acters
from
the
rock-pigeon
yet
by
comaﬁaring
the
several
sub-breeds
of
these
breeds
more
especially
those
brought
from
distant
countries
we
can
make
an
almost
perfect
series
between
the
extremes
of
structure
thirdly
those
characters
which
are
mainly
distinctive
of
each
breed
for
instance
the
wattle
and
length
of
beak
of
the
carrier
the
shortness
of
that
of
the
tumbler
and
the
number
of
tail
feathers
in
the
fantail
are
in
each
breed
eminently
vari
able
and
the
explanation
of
this
fact
will
be
obvious
when
we
come
to
treat
of
selection
fourthly
pigeons
have
been
watched
and
tended
with
the
utmost
care
and
loved
by
many
people
they
have
been
domesticated
for
thousands
of
years
in
several
quarters
of
the
world
earliest
known
record
of
pigeons
is
in
the
fifth
dynasty
about
3000
b
¢
as
was
pointed
out
to
me
by
professor
lepsius
but
mr
birch
informs
me
that
pﬁeons
are
given
in

of
fare
in
the
previous
ti;nasty
the
time
of
the
romans
as
we
hear
from
pliny
immense
prices
were
given
for
pigeons
nay
they
are

to
this

that
they
can

up
their

pigeons
were
much
valued
by
akber
khan
in
india
about
the
year
1600
never
less
than
20,000
pigeons
were
taken
with
the
court
the
monarchs
of
iran
and
turan
sent
him
some
very
rare
birds
and
continues
the
courtly
historian
his
majesty
by
crossing
the
breeds
which
method
was
never
practised
gefore
has
improved
them
astonishingly
about
this
same
period
the
dutch
were
as
eager
about
pigeons
as
were
the
old
romans
the
paramount
importance
of
these
considerations
in
ex
elsining
the
immense
amount
of
variation
which
pigeons
ave
undergone
will
be
obvious
when
we
treat
of
elec
tion
we
shall
then
also
see
how
it
is
that
the
breeds
80
often
have
somewhat
monstrous
character
it
is
also
most
favourable
circumstance
for
the
production
of
dis
tinct
breeds
that
male
and
female
pigeons
can
be
easily
mated
for
life
and
thus
different
breeds
can
be
kept

discussed
the
robg)le
origin
of
domestic

at
some
yet
quite
insufficient
length
because
gvl%:;i
first
kept
gigeons
and
watehed
the
ga%leral
kinds
knowing
well
how
true
they
bred
felt
fully
as
much
difficulty
in
believing
that
they
could
ever
have
descended
from
common
parent
as
any
naturalist
could
in
comin
to
similar
conclusion
in
regard
to
the
many
species
of
finches
or
other
large
groups
of
birds
in
nature
one
circumstance
has
struck
me
much
namely
that
all
the
breeders
of
the
various
domestic
animals
and
the
culti
vators
of
plants
with
whom
have
ever
conversed
or
whose
treatises
have
read
are
firmly
convinced
that
the
several
breeds
to
which
each
has
attended
are
descended
from
so
many
aboriginally
distinct
species
ask
as
have
asked
celebrated
raiser
of
hereford
cattle
whether
his
cattle
might
not
have
descended
from
long-horns
and
he
will
laugh
you
to
scorn
have
never
met
pigeon
or
poultry
or
duck
or
rabbit
fancier
who
was
not
fully
couvinced
that
each
main
breed
was
descended
from
distinct
species
van
mons
in
his
treatise
on
pears
and
appler
shows
how
utterly
he
disbelieves
that
the
several
sorts
for
instance
ribston-pippin
or
codlin-apple
could
ever
have
proceeded
from
the
seeds
of
the
same
tree
in
czar
l
selection
by
man
88
numerable
other
examples
could
be
given
the
explana
tion
think
is
simple
from
long-continued
study
they
are
strongly
impressed
with
the
differences
between
the
several
races
and
though
they
well
know
that
each
race
varies
slliﬁhtly
for
they
win
their
prizes
by
seclecting
such
slight
differences
yet
thelv1
ignore
all
general
arguments
and
refuse
to
sum
up
in
their
minds
slight
differences
ac
cumulated
during
many
successive
generations
may
not
those
naturalists
who
knowing
far
less
of
the
laws
of
in
heritance
than
does
the
breeder
and
knowing
no
more
than
he
does
of
the
intermediate
links
in
the
long
lines
of
descent
yet
admit
that
many
of
our
domestic
races
have
descended
from
the
same
parents—may
they
not
learn
lesson
of
caution
when
they
deride
the
idea
of
species
in
state
of
nature
being
lineal
descendants
of
other
species
selection.—let
us
now
briefly
consider
the
steps
by
which
domestic
races
have
been
produced
either
from
one
or
from
several
allied
species
some
little
effect
may
perhaps
be
attributed
to
the
direct
action
of
the
external
conditions
of
life
and
some
little
to
habit
but
he
would
be
bold
man
who
would
account
by
such
agencies
for
the
differences
of
dray
and
race
horse
greyhound
and
bloodhound
carrier
and
tumbler
pigeon
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
in
our
domesticated
races
is
that
we
see
in
them
adaptation
not
indeed
to
the
animal’s
or
plant’s
own
leood
but
to
man’s
use
or
fancy
some
variations
useful
to
him
have
probably
arisen
suddenly
or
by
one
step
many
botanists
for
instance
believe
that
the
fuller’s
teazle
with
its
hooks
which
cannot
be
rivalled
by
any
mechanical
contrivance
is
only
variety
of
the
wild
dipsacus
and
this
amount
of
change
may
have
sud
denly
arisen
in
seedling
so
it
has
probably
been
with
the
turnspit
dog
and
this
is
known
to
have
been
the
case
with
the
ancon
sheep
but
when
we
compare
the
dray
horse
and
race-horse
the
dromedary
and
camel
the
va
rious
breeds
of
sheep
fitted
either
for
cultivated
land
or
mountain
pasture
with
the
wool
of
one
breed
for
one
purpose
and
that
of
another
breed
for
another
pur
pose
when
we
compare
the
many
breeds
of
dogs
each
good
for
man
in
very
different
ways
when
we
compare
84
selection
by
man
{cmr
the
game-cock
so
pertinacious
in
battle
with
other
breeds
so
little
quarrelsome
with
everlasting
layers
which
never
desire
to
sit
and
with
the
bantam
so
small
and
elegant
when
we
compare
the
host
of
agricultural
culi
nary
orchard
and
flower-garden
races
of
plants
most
use
ful
to
man
at
different
seasons
and
for
different
purposes
or
8o
beautiful
in
his
eyes
we
must
think
look
further
than
to
mere
variability
we
cannot
suppose
that
all
the
breeds
were
suddenly
produced
as
perfect
and
as
useful
a8
we
now
see
them
indeed
in
several
cases
we
know
that
this
has
not
been
their
history
the
key
is
man’s
power
of
accumulative
selection
nature
gives
successive
variations
man
adds
them
up
in
certain
directions
useful
to
him
in
this
sense
he
may
be
said
to
make
for
himself
useful
breeds
the
great
power
of
this
principle
of
selection
is
not
hypothetical
it
is
certain
that
several
of
our
eminent
breeders
have
even
within
single
lifetime
modified
to
large
extent
some
breeds
of
cattle
and
sheep
in
order
fully
to
realise
what
they
have
done
it
is
almost
necessary
to
read
several
of
the
many
treatises
devoted
to
this
sub
ject
and
to
inspect
the
animals
breeders
habitually
speak
of
an
ammal’s
organisation
as
something
quite
fastic
which
they
can
model
almost
as
they
please
if
had
space
could
quote
numerous
passages
to
this
effect
from
highly
competent
authorities
youatt
who
was
probably
better
acquainted
with
the
works
of
agricultur
1sts
than
almost
any
other
individual
and
who
was
him
self
very
good
judge
of
an
animal
speaks
of
the
prin
ciple
of
gelection
as
that
which
enabi)es
the
agricultur
ist
not
only
to
modify
the
character
of
his
flock
but
to
change
it
altogether
it
is
the
ician’s
wand
by
means
of
which
he
may
summon
into
life
whatever
form
and
mould
he
pleases
lord
somerville
speaking
of
what
breeders
have
done
for
sheep
says
it
would
seem
as
if
they
had
chalked
out
upon
wall
form
per
fect
in
itself
and
then
had
given
it
existence
at
most
skilful
breeder
sir
john
sebright
used
to
say
with
respect
to
pigeons
that
he
would
produce
any
given
feather
in
t|
years
but
it
would
take
him
six
years
to
cuar

in

the
importance
of
the
principle
of
selection
in
regard
to
merino
sheep
is
so
fully
recognised
that
men
follow
it
as
trade
the
sheep
are
pl
on
table
and
are
studied
like
picture
by
connoisseur
this
is
done
three
times
at
intervals
of
months
and
the
sheep
are
each
time
marked
and
classed
g
mg_at
the
very
best
may
ultimately
be
selected
for
in
tht
english
breeders
have
actually
effected
is
proved
by
the
enormous
prices
given
for
nnimngs
with
good
ped
igree
and
these
have
now
been
exported
to
almost
every
quarter
of
the
world
the
improvement
is
by
no
means
ﬁenerally
due
to
crossing
different
breeds
all
the
best
reeders
are
strongl
onosed
to
this
practice
except
sometimes
amongst
closely
allied
sub-breeds
and
when
cross
has
been
made
tie
closest
selection
is
far
more
indispensable
even
than
in
ordinary
cases
if
selection
consisted
merely
in
separating
some
very
distinct
variety
and
breeding
from
it
the
principle
would
be
so
obvious
as
hardly
to
be
worth
notice
~but
its
importance
con
sists
in
the
great
effect
produced
by
the
accumulation
in
one
direction
during
successive
generations
of
differences
absolutely
inappreciable
by
an
uneducated
eye—differ
ences
which
fopr
one
have
vainly
attempted
to
appre
ciate
not
one
man
in
thousand
has
accuracy
of
eye
and
judgment
sufficient
to
become
an
eminent
breeder
if
gifted
with
these
qualities
and
he
studies
his
subject
for
years
and
devotes
his
lifetime
to
it
with
indomitable
perseverance
he
will
succeed
and
may
make
great
im
provements
if
he
wants
any
of
these
qualities
he
will
as
suredly
fail
few
would
readily
believe
in
the
natural
capacity
and
years
of
practice
requisite
to
become
even
skilful
pigeon-fancier
the
same
principles
are
followed
by
horticulturists
but
the
variations
are
here
often
more
abrupt
no
one
supposes
that
our
choicest
productions
have
been
pro
duced
by
single
variation
from
the
aboriginal
stock
we
have
proofs
that
this
is
not
so
in
some
cases
in
which
exact
records
have
been
kept
thus,to

very
trifling

steadily
increasing

methodical
selection
cmar
berry
may
be
quoted
we
see
an
astonishing
improve
ment
in
many
florists
flowers
when
the
flowers
of
the
present
day
are
compared
with
drawings
made
only
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
when
race
of
plants
is
once
ig)retty
well
established
the
seed-raisers
do
not
pick
out
the
best
plants
but
merely
over
their
seed-beds
and
pull
up
the
rogues
as
they
call
the
plants
that
deviate
from
the
proper
standard
with
animals
this
kind
of
selection
is
in
fact
also
followed
for
hardly
any
one
is
8o
careless
as
to
allow
his
worst
animals
to
breed
in
regard
to
plants
there
is
another
means
of
observing
the
accumulated
effects
of
selection—namely
by
compar
ing
the
diversity
of
flowers
in
the
different
varieties
of
the
same
species
in
the
flower-garden
the
diversity
of
leaves
pods
or
tubers
or
whatever
part
is
valued
in
the
kitchen-garden
in
comparison
with
the
flowers
of
the
same
varieties
and
the
diversity
of
fruit
of
the
same
species
in
the
orchard
in
companson
with
the
leaves
and
owers
of
the
same
set
of
varieties
see
how
different
the
leaves
of
the
cabbage
are
and

as

cannot
doubt
that

will
produce

in

be
objected
that

the
result
may
add
has
been
in

to
the
full
acknowledgment
of
the
importance
of
the
principle
in
works
of
hlﬁmﬁquity
in
rude
and
barbarous
periods
of
english
history
choice
animals
were
often
imported
and
laws
were
passed
to
prevent
their
exportation
the
destruction
of
horses
under

was
ordered
and
this
may
be
compared
to
the
roguing
of
plants
by
nurserymen
the
principle
of
selection
find
dis
tinetly
given
in
an
ancient
chinese
encyclopedia
ex
plicit
rules
are
laid
down
by
some
of
the
roman
classical
writers
from
passages
in
genesis
it
is
clear
that
the
colour
of
domestic
animals
was
at
that
early
period
at
tended
to
savages
now
sometimes
cross
their
dogs
with
wild
canine
animals
to
improve
the
breed
and
they
formerly
did
so
a8
is
attested
by
passages
in
pliny
the
savages
in
south
africa
match
their
draught
cattle
by
colour
as
do
some
of
the
esquimaux
their
teams
of
dogs
livingstone
shows
how
much
good
domestic
breeds
are
valued
by
the
negroes
of
the
interior
of
africa
who
have
not
associated
with
europeans
some
of
these
facts
do
not
show
actual
selection
but
they
show
that
the
breeding
of
domestic
animals
was
carefully
attended
to
in
ancient
times
and
is
now
attended
to
by
the
lowest
savages
it
would
indeed
have
been
strange
fact
had
attention
not
been
paid
to
breeding
for
the
inheritance
of
good
and
bad
qualities
is
so
obvious
at
the
present
time
eminent
breeders
try
by
methodi
cal
selection
with
distinet
object
in
view
to
make
new
strain
or
sub-breed
superior
to
any
thing
existing
in
the
country
baut
for
our
purpose
kind
of
selection
which
may
be
called
unconscious
and
which
results
from
every
one
trying
to
possess
and
breed
from
the
best
individua
animals
is
more
important
thus
man
who
intends
keeping
pointers
naturally
tries
to
get
as
good
dogs
as
he
can
and
afterwards
breeds
from
his
own
best
dogs
but
he
has
no
wish
or
expectation
of
permanently
altering
the
breed
nevertheless
cannot
doubt
that
this
process
continued
during
centuries
would
improve
and
modify
any
breed
in
the
same
way
as
bakewell
collins
&'c
by
this
very
same
process
only
carried
on
more
methodically
38
unconboious

{omr
did
greatly
modify
even
during
their
own
lifetimes
the
forms
and
qualities
of
their
cattle
slow
and
insensible
changes
of
this
kind
could
never
be
recognised
unless
actual
measurements
or
careful
drawings
of
the
breeds
in
question
had
been
made
long
ago
which
might
serve
for
comparison
in
some
cases
however
unchanged
or
but
little
changed
individuals
of
the
same
breed
may
be
found
in
less
civilized
districts
where
the
breed
has
been
less
improved
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
king
charles’s
spaniel
has
been
unconsciously
modified
to
large
extent
since
the
time
of
that
monarch
some
highly
competent
anthorities
are
convinced
that
the
setter
is
directly
derived
from
the
spaniel
and
has
probably
been
slowly
altered
from
it
it
is
known
that
the
english
pointer
has
been
greatly
ehanged
within
the
last
century
and
in
this
case
the
change
has
it
is
believed
been
chiefly
effected
by
crosses
with
the
fox-hound
but
what
concerns
us
is
that
the
change
has
been
effected
unconsciously
and
fradually
and
yet
so
effectually
that
though
the
old
spanish
pointer
certainly
came
from
spain
mr
borrow
has
not
seen
a8
am
informed
by
him
any
native
dog
in
spain
like
our
pointer
by
similar
process
of
selection
and
by
careful
train
ing
t{e
whole
body
of
englich
race-horses
have
come
to
surpass
in
fleetness
and
size
the
parent
arab
stock
so
that
the
latter
by
the
regulations
for
the
goodwood
races
are
favoured
in
the
weights
they
carry
lord
spencer
and
others
have
shown
how
the
cattle
of
england
have
increased
in
weight
and
in
early
maturity
compared
with
the
stock
formerly
kept
in
this
country
by
com
paring
the
accounts
given
in
old
pigeon
treatises
of
car
riers
and
tumblers
with
these
breeds
as
now
existing
in
britain
india
and
persia
we
can
think
clearly
trace
the
stages
through
which
they
have
insensibly
passed
and
come
to
differ
so
greatly
from
the
rock-pigeon
youatt
gives
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
effects
of
course
of
selection
which
may
be
considered
as
uncon
sciously
followed
in
so
far
that
the
breeders
could
never
have
expected
or
even
have
wished
to
have
produced
the
result
which
ensued—namely
the
production
of
two
dis
cmar
l
unconsuious

89
tinct
strains
the
two
flocks
of
leicester
sheep
kept
by
mr
buckley
and
mr
burgess
as
mr
youatt
remarks
have
been
purely
bred
from
the
original
stock
of
mr
bakewell
for
upwards
of
fifty
years
ere
is
not
sus
picion
existing
in
the
mind
of
any
one
at
all
acquainted
with
the
subject
that
the
owner
of
either
of
them
has
deviated
in
any
one
instance
from
the
pure
blood
of
mr
bakewell’s
flock
and
yet
the
difference
between
the
sheep
possessed
by
these
two
gentlemen
is
so
great
that
they
have
the
appearance
of
being
quite
different
va
rieties
if
there
exist
savages
so
barbarous
as
never
to
think
of
the
inherited
character
of
the
offspring
of
their
domestic
animals
yet
any

animal

useful
to
them
for
any
special
ose
would
be
carefully
preserved
dur
in%
famines
and
other
accidents
to
which
savages
are
so
liable
and
such
choice
animals
would
thus
generally
leave
more
offspring
than
the.inferior
ones
so
that
in
this
case
there
would
be
kind
of
unconscious
selection
going
on
we
see
the
value
set
on
animals
even
by
the
barbarians
of
tierra
del

by
their
killing
and
devouring
their
old
women
in
times
of

as
of
less
value
than
their

in

the

gradual
process
of
improvement
through
the
occasional
preservation
of
the
best
individuals
whether

not
sufficiently
distinet
to
be
ranked
at
their

as

varieties
and
whether
or
not
two
or
more
species
or
races
have
become
blended
together
by
crossing
may
plainly
be
recognised
in
the
increased
size
and
beauty
which
we
now
see
in
the
varieties
of
the
heartsease
rose
pelargonium
dahlia
and
other
plants
when
compared
with
the
older
varieties
or
with
their
parent-stocks
no
one
would
ever
expect
to
get

from

in

appears
from

to
have

gardeners
in
having
produced
such
splendid
results
from
such
poor
materials
but
the
art
canot
doubt
has
been
simple
and
as
far
as
the
final
result
is
concerned
has
been
followed
almost
unconsciously
it
has
consisted
in
always
cultivating
the
best
known
variety
sowing
its
seeds
and
when
slightly
better
variety
has
chanced
to
afpear
selecting
it
and
so
onwards
dbut
the
gardeners
of
the
classical
period
who
cultivated
the
best
pear
they
could
procure
never
thought
what
splendid
fruit
we
should
eat
though
we
owe
our
excellent
fruit
in
some
small
degree
to
their
having
naturally
chosen
and
pre
served
the
best
varieties
they
could
anywhere
find
large
amount
of
change
in
our
cultivated
plants
thus
slowly
and
unconsciously
accumulated
explains
as
believe
the
well-known
fact
that
in
vast
number
of
cases
we
cannot
recognise
and
therefore
do
not
know
the
wild
parent-stocks
of
the
plants
which
have
been
longest
cultivated
in
our
flower
and
kitchen
gardens
if
it
%jas
taken
centuries
or
thousands
of
years
to
improve
or
modify
most
of
our
plants
up
to
their
present
standard
of
usefulness
to
man
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
neither
australia
the
cape
of
good
hope
nor
any
other
region
inhabited
by
quite
uncivilised
man
has
afforded
us
single
plant
worth
culture
it
is
not
that
these
countries
so
rich
in
species
do
not
by
strange
chance
possess
the
aboriginal
stocks
of
any
useful
plants
but
that
the
native
plants
have
not
been
improved
by
continued
selection
up
to
standard
of
perfection
comparable
with
that
given
to
the
plants
in
countries
anciently
civilised
regard
to
the
domestic
animals
kept
by
uncivilised
man
it
should
not
be
overlooked
that
they
aiyxnost
always
have
to
struggle
for
their
own
food
at
least
during
certain
seasons
and
in
two
countries
very
differently
circum
stanced
individuals
of
the
same
species
having
slightly
different
constitutions
or
structure
would
often
succeed
better
in
the
one
country
than
in
the
other
and
thus
by
rocess
of
natural
selection
as
will
hereafter
be
more
fully
explained
two
sub-breeds
might
be
formed
this
perhaps
partly
explains
what
has
been
remarked
by
some
authors
namely
that
the
varieties
kept
by
savages
have
cur
l
seleotion
by
max
more
of
the
character
of
species
than
the
varieties
kept
in
civilised
countries
on
the
view
here
given
of
the
all-important
part
which
selection
by
man
has
played
it
becomes
at
once
obvious
how
it
is
that
our
domestic
races
show
adaptation
in
their
structare
or
in
their
hlabits
to
man’s
wants
or
fancies
we
can
think
further
understand
the
frequently
ab
normal
character
of
our
domestic
races
and
likewise
their
differences
being
so
great
in
external
characters
and
rela
tively
so
slight
in
internal
parts
or
organs
man
can
hardly
select
or
only
with
much
diﬂicnlt{l
any
deviation
of
structure
excepting
such
as
is
externally
visible
and
indeed
he
rarely
cares
for
what
is
internal
he
can
never
act
by
selection
exceptin%l
on
variations
which
are
first
given
to
him
in
some
slight
degree
by
nature
no
man
would
ever
try
to
make
fantail
till
he
saw
pigeon
with

developed
in
some
slight
degree
in
an
unusual

he
saw

with

of
some
what
unusual
size
and
the
more
abnormal
or
unusual
any
character
was
when
it
first
appeared
the
more
likely
it
would
be
to
catch
his
attention
but
to
use
such
an
expression
as
trying
to
make

is
have
no
doubt
in
most
cases
utterly
incorrect
the
man
who
first
select
ed
pigeon
with
slitgliltly
larger
tail
never
dreamed
what
the
descendants
of
that
pigeon
would
become
through
long-continued
partly
unconscious
and
fparﬂy
methodical
selection
perbaps
the
parent
bird
of
all
fantails
had
only
fourteen
tail-feathers
somewhat
expanded
like
the
present
java
fantail
or
like
individuals
of
other
and
dis
tinct
breeds
in
which
as
many
as
seventeen
tail-feathers
have
been
counted
perhaps
the
first
pouter-pigeon
did
not
inflate
its
crop
much
more
than
the
turbit
now
does
the
upper
part
of
its
cesophagus,—a
habit
which
is
dis
regarded
by
all
fanciers
as
it
is
not
one
of
the
points
of
the
breed
nor
let
it
be
thought
that
some
%:‘eat
deviation
of
structure
would
be
necessary
to
catch
the
fancier’s
eye
he
perceives
extremely
small
differences
and
it
is
in
human
nature
to
value
any
novel:i
however

be
disre%arded
when

by

slow
and
gradual
process
they
will
spread
more
widely
and
will
get
recognised
as
something
distinct
and
valuable
and
will
then
robably
first
receive
provincial

as
the

of
the

are

fully
acknowledged
the
principle
as
have
called
it
of
unconscious
selection
will
always
tend,—perhaps
more
at
one
period
than
at
another
as
the
breed
rises
or
falls
in
fashion,—perhaps
more
in
one
district
than
in
another
according
to
%e
state
of

of
the
inhabitants,—slowly
to
add
to
the
characteristic

of

whatever
they
may
be

the
chance
will
be
infinitely
small
of
any

now

on

48
favourable
or
the
reverse
to

power
of

high
degree
of

is
obviously
favourable
as
freely
giving
the
materials
er
selection
to
work
on
not
that
mere
individual
differences
are
not
amply
sufficient
with
extreme
care
to
allow
of
the
accumulation
of
large
amount
of
modification
in
almost
any
desired
direction
but
as
variations
manifestly
useful
or
pleasing
to
man
gﬁear
only
occasionally
the
chance
of
their
ap
ce
ill
be
much
increased
by
large
number
of
individuals
being
kept
and
hence
this
comes
to
be
of
the
highest
importance
to
success
on
this
principle
marshall
has
remarked
with
respect
to
sheep
of
parts
of
yorkshire
that
as
they
generally
belong
to
poor
people
and
are
mostly
<n
small
lots
they
never
can
be
improved
on
the
other
hand
nurserymen
from
raising
large
stocks
of
the
same
plants
are
generally
far
more
successful
than
amateurs
in
getting
new
and
valuable
varieties
the
keep
ing
of
large
number
of
individuals
of
species
in
any
country
requires
that
the
species
should
be
placed
under
favourable
conditions
of
life
so
as
to
breed
freely
in
that
country
when
the
individuals
of
any
species
are
scanty
all
the
individuals
whatever
their
quality
may
be
will
gen
erally
be
allowed
to
breed
and
this
will

of

that

much
valued

that
1t
was
most
fortunate
that
the
strawberry
began
to
vary
just
when
gardeners
began
to
attend
closely
to
this

no

the
strawberry
had
a\wags
varied
since
it
was
cultivated
but
the
slight
varieties
had
been
neglected
as
soon
however
as
gardeners
picked
out
individual
plants
with
slightly
larger
earlier
or
better
fruit
and
raised
seedlings
from
them
and
again
picked
out
the

from

one

pigeons
can
be
mated
for

and
this
is
great
convenience
to
the
fancier
for
thus
many
races
may
be
kept
true
though
mingled
in

and
this
circumstance
must
have
largely
favoured
the
improvement
and
formation
of
new

be

in

numbers
and
at

quick

and
inferior

may
be
freely
rejected
as
when

they
serve
for
food
on
the

hand
cats
from
their
nocturnal
rambling
habits
cannot
be
matched
and
although
so
much
valued
by
women
and
children
we
hardly
ever
see
distinct
breed
kept
up
such
breeds
as
we
do
sometimes
see
are
almost
always
imported
from
some
other
countty
often
from
islands
although
do
not
doubt
that
some
domestic
animals
vary
less
than
others
yet
the
rarity
or
absence
of
distinct
breeds
of
the
cat
the
donkey
peacock

&c
may
be
attributed
in
main
part
to
selection
not

into
play
in

from
the
diﬂ'iculfg
in

from
only

poor
people
and
little
attention
paid
to
their

ing
in
peacocks
from
not
being
very
easily
reared
and
large
stock
not
kept
in
geese
from
being
valuable
only
for
two
purposes
food
and
feathers
and
more
es
pecially
from
no
pleasure
having
been
felt
in
the
display
of
distinct
breeds
to
sum
up
on
the
origin
of
our
domestic
races
of
ani
mals
and
plants
believe
that
the
conditions
of
life
from
their
action
on
the
reproductive
system
are
so
far
of
the
highest
importance
as
causing
variability
do
not
believe
that
variability
is
an
inherent
and
necessary
contingency
under
all
circumstances
with
all
organic
beings
as
some
authors
have
thought
the
effects
of
variability
are
modified
by
various
degrees
of
inheritance
and
of
reversion
variability
is
governed
by
many
un
omar

43

laws
more
especially
by
that
of
correlation
of

something
may
be
attributed
to
the
direct
action
of
the
conditions
of
life
something
must
be
attributed
to
use
and
disuse
the
final
resultis
thus
rendered
in
finitely
complex
in
some
cases
do
not
doubt
that
the
intercrossing
of
species
aboriginally
distinct
has
played
an
important
part
in
the
origin
of
our
domestic
uc
tions
when
in
any
country
several
domestic
breeds
have
once
been
established
their
occasional
intercrossing
with
the
aid
of
selection
has
no
doubt
largely
aided
in
the
formation
of
new
sub-breeds
but
the
importance
of
the
crossing
of
varieties
has
believe
been
greatly
ex
rated
both
in
regard
to
animals
and
to
those
plants
which
are
propagated
by
seed
in
plants
which
are
temporarily
propagated
by
cuttings
buds
&c
the
importance
of
the
crossing
both
of
distinct
species
and
of
varieties
is
im
mense
for
the
cultivator
here
quite
disregards
the
ex
treme
variability
both
of
hybrids
and
mongrels
and
the
frequent
sterility
of
hybrids
but
the
cases
of
plants
not
plxl-opagated
by
seed
are
of
little
importance
to
us
for
their
endurance
is
only
temporary
over
all
these
causes
of
change
am
convinced
that
the
accumulative
action
of
selection
whether
applied
methodically
and
more
quickly
or
unconsciously
and
more
slowly
but
more
efficiently
is
by
far
the
predominant
power

arrived

shal

work
nor
shall
here
discuss
the
various
definitions
which
have
been
given
of
the

no

definition
has
as
yet
satisfied
all
natural
ists
yet
every
naturalist
knows
vaguely
what
he
means
when
he
speaks
of
species
generally
the
term
includes
the
unknown
element
of
distinct
act
of
creation
the
term
variety
is
almost
equally
difficult
to
define
but
here
community
of
descent
is
almost
universally
implied
though
it
can
rarely
be
proved
we
have
also
what

ca.llei

they
graduate
into

monstrosity

considerable
deviation

either
injurious

due

and
variations
in

are
sup

not

who
can
say
that
the

of

of

and
in

presume
that
the

be

again
we
have
many
slight
differences
which
may
be
called
individual
di.ﬂzrences
such
as
are
known
fre

to
appear
in

which
may

supposes

are

in

these
individual

a.rem]:n;fhly
important
for
us
as
they
afford
materials
for

to
accumulate
in
the

manner
as

or
classificatory
point
of

sometimes
vary

am
convinced
that
the
most

naturalist
would
be
surprised
at
the
number
of
the
cases
of
variabilitﬁ
even
in
important
parts
of

which
he
could
collect
on

authority
as
have
collected
during
course
of
years
it
should
be
remembered
that
systematists
are
far
from
pleased
at
finding
variability
in
important
characters
and
that
there
are
not
many
men
who
will
laboriously
examine
internal
and
important

and_compare
them

never

expected
that
the

of
the

would
have
been

in

quite

genera

in

and
likewise
judging
from

at

ese
facts

be

for
they
seem
to

that
this
kind

independent

to
suspect
that
we

in

as
hereafter

be
explained
those
forms
which
possess
in
some
considerable
de
gree
the
character
of

but
which
are
so
closely
similar
to
some

are
so
closely

them
by
intermediate
gradations
that
natumrists
do
not
like
to
rank
them
as

in
several
re
spects
the
most
important
for
us
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
many
of
these
doubtful
and
closely-allied
forms
have
permanently
retained
their
characters
in
their
own
country
for
long
time
for
as
long
as
far
as
we
know
as
have
good
and
true
species
practically
when
naturalist
can
unite
two
forms
together
by
others
hav
ing
intermediate
characters
he
treats
the

as

but
sometimes
the
one
first
described

the

as
the

but
cases
of
great
difficulty
which
will
not
here
enumerate
sometimes
occur
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
rank
one
form
as

of

even
when
they
are
closely

by
intermediate

nor

the

always
remove
the
difficulty
in
ves
many
cases
however
one
form
is
ranked
as
variety
another
not
because
the
intermediate
links
have
actually
been
found
but
because
analogy
leads
the
observer
to
suppose
either
that
they
do
now
somewhere

may
formerly

here

for
the

the

only
guide

we
must
however
in

de
cide
by

overwhelming
amount
of
experimental
evidence
showing
that
they
descend
from
common
parents
and
consequently
must
be
ranked
as
varieties
close
investigation
in
most
cases
will
bring
natural
ists
to
an
agreement
how
to
rank
doubtful
forms
yet
it
must
be
confessed
that
it
is
in
the
best-known
countries
that
we
find
the
greatest
number
of
forms
of
doubtful
value
have
been
struck
with
the
fact
that
if
any
animal
or
plant
in
state
of
nature
be
highly
useful
to
man
or
from
any
cause
closely
attract
his
attention
va
rieties
of
it
will
almost
universally
be
found
recorded
these
varieties
moreover
will
be
often
ranked
by
some
authors
as
species
look
at
the
common
oak
how
closely
it
has
been
studied
yet
german
author
makes
more
than
dozen
species
out
of
forms
which
are
ve
gﬁner
ally
considered
as
varieties
and
in
this
country
the
high
est
botanical
authorities
and
practical
men
can
be
quoted
to
show
that
the
sessile
and
pedunculated
oaks
are
either
good
and
distinct
species
or
mere
varieties
when
young
naturalist
commences
the
study
of
group
of
organisms
quite
unknown
to
him
he
is
at
first
much
perplexed
to
determine
what
differences
to
consider
ag
specific
and
what
as
varieties
;
for
he
knows
nothing
of
tﬁ:c
amount
and
kind
of
variation
to
which
the
group
is
subject
and
this
shows
at
least
how
very
generally
there
is
some
variation
but
if
he
confine
his
attention
53
doubtful
sbpecies
ontar
i1
to
one
class
within
one
country
he
will
soon
make
up
his
mind
how
to
rank
most
of
the
doubtful
forms
his
gen
eral
tendency
will
be
to
make
many
species
for
he
will
be
come
impressed
just
like
the
pigeon
or
poultry
fancier
be
fore
alluged
to
with
the
amount
of
difference
in
the
forms
which
he
is
continually
studying
and
he
has
little
gen
eral
knowledge
of
analogical
variation
in
other
groups
and
in
other
countries
by
which
to
correct
his
first
im
ressions
as
he
extends
the
of
his
observations
will
meet
with
more
cases
of
difficulty
for
he
will
en
counter
greater
number
of
closely-allied
forms
but
if
his
observations
be
widely
extended
he
will
in
the
end
gen
erally
be
enabled
to
make
up
his
own
mind
which
to
call
varieties
and
which
species
but
he
will
succeed
in
this
at
the
expense
of
admitting
much
variation,—and
the
truth
of
this
admission
will
often
be
disputed
by
other
naturalists
when
moreover
he
comes
to
study
allied
forms
brought
from
countries
not
now
continuous
in
which
case
ﬁe
can
hardly
hope
to
find
the
intermediate
links
between
his
doubtful
forms
he
will
have
to
trust
almost
entirely
to
analogy
and
his
difficulties
will
rise
to
climax
certainly
no
clear
line
of
demarcation
has
as
yet
been
drawn
between
species
and
sub-species—that
is
the
forms
which
in
the
opinion
of
some
naturalists
come
very
near
to
but
do
not
quite
arrive
at
the
rank
of
species
or
again
between
sub-species
and
well-marked
varieties
or
between
lesser
varieties
and
individual
differences
these
differences
blend
into
each
other
in
an
insensible
series
and
series
impresses
the
mind
with
the
idea
of
an
actual
assage
h%ice
look
at
individual
differences
though
of
small
interest
to
the
systematist
as
of
high
importance
for
us
as
being
the
first
step
towards
such
slight
varieties
as
are
barely
thought
worth
recording
in
works
on
natural
his
otory
and
look
at
varieties
which
are
in
any
degree
more
distinet
and
permanent
as
steps
leading
to
more
stron%]y
marked
and
more
permanent
varieties
and
at
these
latter
as
leading
to
sub-species
and
tospecies
the
passage
from
one
stage
of
difference
to
another
and
higher
cmar
tlj
varieties
graduate
into
species
58
may
be
in
some
cases
due
merely
to
the
long-con
tinued
action
of
different
physical
conditions
in
two
dif
ferent
regions
but
have
not
much
faith
in
this
view
and
attribute
the
passage
of
variety
from
state
in
which
it
differs
very
slightly
from
its
parent
to
one
in
which
it
diffegs
more
to
the
action
of
natural
selection
in
accumulating
as
will
hereafter
be
more
fully
explained
differences
of
structure
in
certain
definite
directions
hence
believe
well-marked
variety
may
be
jjustly
called
an-incipient
species
but
whether
this
belief
be
justifiable
must
be
judged
of
by
the
g}?neral
weight
of
the
several
facts
and
views
given
throughout
this
work
it
need
not
be
supposed
that
all
varieties
or
incipient
species
necessarily
attain
the
rank
of
species
they
may
whilst
in
this
incipient
state
become
extinct
or
they
may
endure
as
varieties
for
very
long
periods
as
has
been
shown
to
be
the
case
by
mr
wollaston
with
the
varietics
of
certain
fossil
land-shells
in
madeira
if
variety
were
to
flourish
so
as
to
exceed
in
numbers
the
parent
species
it
would
then
rank
as
the
species
and
the
species
as
the
variety
or
it
might
come
to
supplant
and
exterminate
the
parent
species
or
both
might
co-exist
and
both
rank
as
independent
species
but
we
shall
hereafter
have
to
return
to
this
subject
from
these
remarks
it
will
be
seen
that
look
at
the
term
species
as
one
arbitrarily
given
for
the
sake
of
con
venience
to
set
of
individuals
closely
resembling
each
other
and
that
it
does
not
essentially
differ
from
the
term
variety
which
is
given
to
less
distinct
and
more
fluctuat
ing
forms
the
term
variety
again
in
comparison
with
mere
individual
differences
is
also
applied
arbitrarily
and
for
mere
convenience
sake
guided
by
theoretical
considerations
thought
that
some
interesting
results
might
be
obtained
in
regard
to
the
nature
and
relations
of
the
species
which
vary
most
by
tabulating
all
the
varieties
in
several
well-worked
floras
at
%rst
this
seemed
simple
task
but
mr
h
c
watson
to
whom
am
much
indebted
for
valuable
advice
and
assistance
on
this
subject
soon
convinced
me
that
there
were
many
difficulties
as
did
subsequently
dr
54
dominant
species
vary
most
cmar
il
hooker
even
in
stronger
terms
shall
reserve
for
my
future
work
the
discussion
of
these
difficulties
and
the
tables
themselves
of
the
proportional
numbers
of
the
vary
ing
species
dr
hooker
permits
me
to
add
that
after
having
carefully
read
my
manuscript
and
examined
the
tables
he
thinks
that
the
following
statements
are
fairly
well
established
the
whole
sub‘l'lect
howefer
treated
as
it
necessarily
here
is
with
much
brevity
is
rather
per
lexing
and
allusions
cannot
be
avoided
to
the
struggle
or
existence
divergence
of
character
and
other
ques
tions
hereafter
to
be
discussed
alph
de
candolle
and
others
have
shown
that
plants
which
have
very
wide
ranges
generally
present
varieties
and
this
might
have
been
expected
as
they
become
ex
to
diverse
physical
conditions
and
as
they
come
into
competition
which
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
is
far
more
important
circumstance
with
different
sets
of
or
e:.:lic
beings
but
my
tables
further
show
that
in
any
ited
country
the
species
which
are
most
common
that
is
abound
most
in
individuals
and
the
species
which
are
most
widely
diffused
within
their
own
country
and
this
is
different
consideration
from
wide
range
and
to
cer
tain
extent
from
commonness
often
give
rise
to
varieties
sufficiently
well-marked
to
have
been
recorded
in
botani
cal
works
hence
it
is
the
most
flourishing
or
as
they
may
be
called
the
dominant
species,—those
which
range
widely
over
the
world
are
the
most
diffused
in
their
own
country
and
are
the
most
numerous
in
individuals
which
oftenest
produce
well-marked
varieties
or
as
con
sider
them
incipient
species
and
this
perhaps
might
have
been
anticipated
for
as
varieties
in
order
to
be
come
in
any
degree
permanent
necessarily
have
to
strug
gle
with
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
country
the
species
which
are
already
dominant
will
be
the
most
likely
to
ield
offspring
which
though
in
some
slight
modi
ed
will
still
inherit
those
advantages
tﬁat
enabled
their
parents
to
become
dominant
over
their
compatriots
if
the
plants
inhabiting
country
an(f
described
in
any
flora
be
divided
into
two
equal
masses
all
those
in
the
larger
genera
being
placed
on
one
side
aud
all
those
omar
i1
species
of
large
genera
variable
58
in
the
smaller
genera
on
the
other
side
somewhat
larger
number
of
the
very
common
and
much
diffused
or
domi
nant
species
will
be
found
on
the
side
of
the
larger
genera
this
again
might
have
been
anticipated
for
the
mere
fact
of
many
species
of
the
same
genus
inhabiting
any
country
shows
that
there
is
something
in
the
organic
or
inorganic
conditions
of
that
coun
avourable
to
the
g:nus
and
consequently
we
might
have
expected
to
ve
found
in
the
larger
genera
or
those
including
many
§ecies
large
proportional
number
of
dominant
species
ut
s0
many
causes
tend
to
obscure
this
result
that
am
surprised
that
my
tables
show
even
small
majority
on
the
side
of
the
larger
genera
will
here
allude
to
only
two
causes
of
obscurity
fresh-water
and
salt-lovin
lants
have
generally
very
wide
and
are
mu
iffused
but
538
seems
to
ye
connected
with
the
nature
of
the
stations
inhabited
by
them
and
has
little
or
no
re
lation
to
the
size
of
the
gemera
to
which
the
species
belong
ﬁfnin
plants
low
in
the
scale
of
organisation
are
generally
much
more
widely
diffused
than
plants
higher
in
the
scale
and
here
there
is
no
close
rela
tion
to
the
size
of
the
genera
cause
of
lowly-organ
ised
plants
ranging
widely
will
be
discussed
in
our
chap
ter
on
geograpﬁil::]s
distribution
from
looking
at
species
as_only
strongly-marked
and
well-defined
varieties
was
led
to
anticipate
that
the
species
of
the
larger
genera
in'each
country
would
oftener
})resent
varieties
than
the
species
of
the
smaller
genera
or
wherever
many
closely
related
species
i
6
species
of
the
same
genus
have
been
formed
many
varieties
or
in
cipient
seecies
ought
as
general
rule
to
be
now
form
ing
where
many
iarge
trees
grow
we
expect
to
find
saplin
where
many
species
of
us
have
been
formed
through
variation
circumstances
have
been
favour
able
for
variation
and
hence
we
mi%ht
expect
that
the
circumstances
would
eenera.lly
be
still
favourable
to
vari
ation
on
the
other
hand
if
we
look
at
each
species
as
special
act
of
creation
there
i8
no
s.p}iluent
reason
why
more
varieties
should
occur
in
group
having
many
spe
cies
than
in
one
having
few
56
speoies
of
large
genera
cxar
ix
to
test
the
truth
of
this
anticipation
have
arranged
the
plants
of
twelve
countries
and
the
coleopterous
in
sects
of
two
districts
into
two
nearly
equal
masses
the
species
of
the
larger
genera
on
one
side
and
those
of
the
smaller
genera
on
the
other
side
and
it
has
invariably
proved
to
be
the
case
that
largevproportion
of
the
spe
cies
on
the
side
of
the
larger
genera
present
varieties
than
on
the
side
of
the
smaller
genera
moreover
the
species
of
the
large
ﬁenera
which
present
any
varieties
invariably
present
larger
average
number
of
varieties
than
do
tﬂe
ies
of
the
small
genera
both
these
re
sults
follow
ﬁf:n
another
division
is
made
and
when
all
the
smallest
genera
with
from
only
one
to
four
species
are
absolutely
excluded
from
the
tables
these
facts
are
of
plain
signification
on
the
view
that
species
are
only
strongly
marked
and
permanent
varieties
for
wherever
many
z}zecies
of
the
same
genus
have
been
formed
or
where
if
we
may
use
the
expression
the
manufactory
of
species
has
been
active
we
ought
generally
to
find
the
manufactory
still
in
action
more
e;pecially
as
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
the
process
of
manufacturing
new
species
to
be
slow
one
this
certainly
is
the
case
if
varieties
be
looked
at
a8
incipient
species
for
my
tables
clearly
show
as
general
rule
that
wherever
many
s}]:e
cies
of
a-genus
have
been
formed
the
species
of
that
genus
present
number
of
varieties
that
is
of
incifient
species
beyond
the
average
it
is
not
that
all
large
enera
are
now
varying
much
and
are
thus
increasing
_in
the
number
of
their
species
or
that
no
small
genera
are
now
varying
and
increasing
for
if
this
had
been
so
it
would
have
been
fatal
to
my
theory
inasmuch
as
logy
plainly
tells
us
that
small
genera
have
in
the
apse
of
time
often
increased
greatly
in
size
and
that
large
genera
have
often
come
to
their
maxima
declined
and
disappeared
all
that
we
want
to
show
is
that
where
many
species
of
genus
have
been
formed
on
an
average
manﬁla.re
still
forming
and
this
holds
good
ere
are
other
relations
between
the
species
of
large
era
and
their
recorded
varieties
which
deserve
notice
have
seen
that
there
is
no
infallible
criterion
by
which
cur
ity
kesemble
varieties
51
to
distinguish
species
and
well-marked
varieties
and
in
those
cases
in
which
intermediate
links
have
not
been
found
between
doubtful
forms
naturalists
are
compelled
to
come
to
determination
by
the
amount
of
difference
between
them
judging
by
analogy
whether
or
not
the
amount
suffices
to
raise
one
or
both
to
the
rank
of
species
hence
the
amount
of
difference
is
one
very
important
criterion
in
settling
whether
two
forms
should
be
ranked
a8
species
or
varieties
now
fries
has
remarked
in
re
to
plants
and
westwood
in
regard
to
insects
that
large
genera
the
amount
of
difference
between
the
spe
cies
is
often
exceedingly
small
have
endeavoured
to
test
this
numerically
by
averages
and
as
far
as
my
im
perfect
results
go
they
always
confirm
the
view
have
also
consulted
some
sagacious
and
most
experienced
ob
servers
and
after
deliberation
they
concur
in
this
view
this
respect
therefore
the
species
of
the
arier
genera
resemble
varieties
more
than
do
the
species
of
the
smaller
genera
or
the
case
may
be
put
in
another
way
and
it
may
be
said
that
in
the
larger
genera
in
which
num
ber
of
varieties
or
incipient
species
greater
than
the
aver
age
are
now
manufacturing
many
of
the
species
already
manufactured
still
to
certain
extent
resemble
varieties
for
they
differ
from
each
other
by
less
than
usual
amount
of
difference
moreover
the
species
of
the
larger
genera
are
related
to
each
other
in
the
same
manner
as
the
varieties
of
any
one
species
are
related
to
each
other
no
naturalist
pre
tends
that
all
the
species
of
genus
are
equally
distinet
from
each
other
eey
may
generally
be
dividedy
into
sub
genera
or
sections
or
lesser
groups
as
fries
has
well
remarked
little
groups
of
species
are
generally
clustered
like
satellites
around
certain
other
species
and
what
are
varieties
but
groups
of
forms
unequally
related
to
each
other
and
clustered
round
certain
forms
that
is
round
their
parent-species
undoubtedly
there
is
one
most
im
portant
point
of
difference
between
varieties
and
species
namely
that
the
amount
of
difference
between
varieties
when
compared
with
each
other
or
with
their
parent
species
is
much
less
than
that
between
the
species
of
the
58
species
of
large
genera
omar
il
same
genus
but
when
we
come
to
discuss
the
rinciﬁ)le
a8
call
it
of
divergence
of
character
we
shall
see
how
this
may
be
explained
and
how
the
lesser
differences
between
varieties
will
tend
to
increase
into
the
greater
differences
between
species
there
is
one
other
point
which
seems
to
me
worth
notice
varieties
generally
have
much
restricted
ranges
this
statement
is
indeed
scarcely
more
than
truism
for
if
variety
were
found
to
have
wider
range
than
that
of
its
supposed
parent-species
their
denominations
ought
to
be
reversed
but
there
is
also
reason
to
believe
that
those
species
which
are
very
closely
allied
to
other
species
and
in
so
far
resemble
varieties
often
have
much
restrict
ed
ranges
for
instance
mr
h
c
watson
has
marked
for
me
in
the
well-sifted
london
catalogue
of
plants
4th
edition
63
plants
which
are
therein
ranked
as

so
that

berore
entering
on
the
subject
of
this
chapter
must
make
few
preliminary
remarks
to
show
how
the
strug
gle
for
existence
bears
on
natural
selection
it
has
been
seen
in
the
last
chapter
that
amongst
ox;ﬁa.nic
beings
in
state
of
nature
there
is
some
individual
variability
in
deed
am
not
aware
that
this
has
ever
been
disputed
it
is
immaterial
for
us
whether
multitude
of
doubtful
forms
be
called
species
or
sub-species
or
varieties
what
rank
for
instance
the
two
or
three
hundred
doubtful
forms
of
british
plants
are
entitled
to
hold
if
the
exist
ence
of
any
well-marked
varieties
be
admitted
but
the
mere
existence
of
individual
variability
and
of
some
few
well-marked
varieties
though
necessary
as
the
foundation
for
the
work
helps
us
but
little
in
understanding
how
species
arise
in
nature
how
have
all
those
exquisite
adaptations
of
one
émrt
of
the
organisation
to
another
part
and
to
the
conditions
of
life
and
of
one
distinct
or
anic
being
to
another
being
been
perfected
we
see
these
beautiful
co-adaptations
most
ﬂhls.inly
in
the
wood
eecker
and
misseltoe
and
only
little
less
plainly
in
the
umblest
parasite
which
clings
to
the
hairs
of
quadruped
or
feathers
of
bird
in
the
structure
of
the

adafdtfﬁons
everywhere
and
in
every
part
of
the
organic
worl
again
it
may
be
asked
how
is
it
that
varieties
which
have
called
incipient
species
become
ultimately
con
verted
into
good
and
distinct
species
which
in
most
cases
obviously
differ
from
each
other
far
more
than
do
the
varieties
of
the
same
species
how
do
those
groups
of
species
which
constitute
what
are
called
distinct
genera
and
which
differ
from
each
other
more
than
do
the
species
of
the
same
genus
arise
all
these
results
as
we
shall
more
fally
see
in
the
next
chapter
follow
inevitably
from
the
struggle
for
life
owing
to
this
struggle
for
life
any
variation
however
slight
and
from
whatever
eause
pro
ceeding
if
it
be
in
any
degree
profitable
to
an
indivi$ual
of
any
species
in
its
infinitely
complex
relations
to
other
organic
beings
and
to
external
nature
will
tend
to
the
reservation
of
that
individual
and
will
generally
be
in
erited
by
its
offspring
the
oﬁzsprin
also
will
thus
have
better
chance
of
surviving
for
of
the
many
individuals
of
any
species
which
are
periodically
born
but
small
number
can
survive
have
calletr
this
principle
by
which
each
slight
variation
if
useful
is
preserved
b
the
term
of
natural
selection
in
order
to
mark
its
relation
to
man’s
power
of
selection
we
have
seen
that
man
by
selection
can
certainly
produce
great
results
and
can
adapt
organic
beings
to
his
own
uses
through
the
accumu
lation
of
slight
but
useful
variations
given
to
him
by
the
hand
of
nature
but
natural
selection
as
we
shall
here
after
see
is
power
incessant17
ready
for
action
and
is
as
immeasurably
superior
to
man’s
feeble
efforts
as
the
works
of
nature
are
to
those
of
art
we
will
now
discuss
little
more
in
detail
the
stru
%}e
for

in
my
future
work
this
subf’ect
shall
be
treated
as
it
well
deserves
at
much
greater
length
the
elder
de
candolle
and
lyelle
have
largely
and
philosophi
cally
shown
that
all
organic
beings
are
exposed
to
severe
competition
in
regard
to

no
one
has
treated
this
subject
with
more
spirit
and
ability
than

the
truth
of

universal

or
more
difficult—at

have
found
it
so—tean
constantly
to
bear
this
conclusion
in
mind
yet
unless
it
be
thorough
ly
engrained
in
the
mind
am
convinced
that
the
whole
economy
of
nature
with
every
fact
on
distribution
rarity
abundance
extinction
and
variation
will
be
dimly
seen
or
%‘:itﬁ
misunderstood
we
behold
the
face
of
nature
bright
with
gladness
we
often
see
superabundance
of
food
we
do
not
see
or
we
forget
that
the
birds
which
are
idly
singing
round
us
mostly
live
on
insects
or
seeds
and
are
thus
constantly
destroying
life
or
we
forget
how
largely
these
songsters
or
their
eggs
or
their
nestlings
are
destroyed
by
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
we
do
not
always
bear
in
mind
that
though
food
may
be
now
superabun
dant
it
is
not
so
at
all
seasons
of
each
recurring
year
should
premise
that
use
the
term
struggle
for

in
large
and
metaphorical
sense
includin
dependence
of

on

whic

the

more
properly
it

produces

on

the

dependent
on
the
apple
and

but
can
only
in
far-fetched
sense
be
said
to

it
will
languish

disseminated

its
existence
depends
on
birds
and
it
may
metaphor
ically
be
said
to
struggle
with
other
fruit-bearing
plants
in
order
to
tempt
birds
to
devour
and
thus
disseminate
its
seeds
rather
than
those
of

struggle

inevitably
follows
from
the
high
rate
at
which
all
organic
beings
tend
to
increase
every
being
which
during
its
natural
lifetime
produces
several
eggs

must
suffer

of
its
life
and
during
some

otherwise
on

of

increase
its

would
quickly
become
so
inordinately
great
that
no

could
support

hence
as
more

are

than

there
must
in

be
struggle

either

or
with
the

or
with

itis
the
doctrine
of
malthus
a%plied
with
manifold
force
to
the
whole
animal

for
in
this
case
there
can
be
no

and
no
prudential
restraint
from

although
some

may
be
now
increasing
more
or
less
rapidly
in
numbers
all
cannot
do
so
for
the
world
would
not
hold
them
there
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
that
every
organic
being
naturally
increases
at
so
high
rate
that
if
not
destroyed
the

would
soon
be
covered
by
the

even

and
at
this
rate
in

there

linnsus
has
calculated
that
if
an

plmr:dpro(fuced
only
two

there
is
no
plant
so
unproductive
as
this—and
their
seedlings
next

produced
two
and
so
on
then
in
twenty
years
there
would
be
million
plants
the
elephant
is
reckoned
to
be
the
slowest
breeder
of
all
known
animals
and
have
taken
some
pains
to
estimate
its
probable
minimum
rate
of
natural
increase
it
will
be
under
the
mark
to
assume
that
it
breeds
when
thirty
years
old
and
goes
on
breeding
till
ninety
years
old
bringing
forth
three
pair
of
young
in
this
interval
if
this
be
so
at
the
end
of
the
fift
cenm
there
would
be
alive
fifteen
million
elephants
descended
from
the
first
pair
but
we
have
better
evidence
on
this
subject
than
mere
theoretical
calculations
namely
the
numerous
recorded
cases
of
the
astonishingly
rapid
increase
of
various
animals
in
state
of
nature
when
circumstances
have
been
64
high
rate
of
increase
cuar
iil
favourable
to
them
during
two
or
three
following
seasons
still
more
striking
is
the
evidence
from
our
domestic
ani
mals
of
many
kinds
which
have
run
wild
in
several
parts
of
the
world
if
the
statements
of
the
rate
of
increase
of
slow-breeding
cattle
and
horses
in
south
america
and
latterly
in
australia
bad
not
been
well
authenticated
they
would
have
been
quite
incredible
so
it
is
with
lants
cases
could
be
given
of
introduced
plants
which
eave
become
common
throughout
whole
islands
in
period
of
less
than
ten
years
several
of
the
plants
now
most
numerous
over
the
wide
plains
of
la
plata
clothin
square
leagues
of
surface
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
other
plants
have
been
introduced
from
europe
and
there
are
plants
which
now
range
in
india
as
hear
from
dr
falconer
from
cape
comorin
to
the
himalaya
which
have
been
imported
from
america
since
its
d};scovery
in
such
cases
and
endless
instances
could
be
given
no
one
supposes
that
the
fertility
of
these
animals
or
plants
has
been
suddenly
and
temporarily
increased
in
any
sensible
degree
the
obvious
explanation
is
that
the
conditions
of
life
have
been
very
favourable
and
that
there
has
conse
3;1ently
been
less
destruction
of
the
old
and
young
and
at
nearly
all
the
young
have
been
enabled
to
breed
in
such
cases
the
geometrical
ratio
of
increase
the
result
of
which
never
fails
to
be
surprising
simply
explains
the
extraordinarily
rapid
increase
and
wide
diffusion
of
natu
ralised
productions
in
their
new
homes
in
state
of
nature
almost
every
plant
produces
sced
and
amongst
animals
there
are
very
few
which
do
not
annu
ally
pair
hence
we
may
confidently
assert
that
all
plants
and
animals
are
tending
to
increase
at
geometrical
ratio
that
all
would
most
rapidly
stock
every
station
in
which
they
could
any
how
exist
and
that
the
geometrical
tendency
to
increase
must
be
checked
by
destruction
at
some
period
of
life
our
familiarity
with
the
larger
domestic
animals
tends
think
to
mislead
us
we
see
no
great
destruction
falling
on
them
and
we
forget
that
thousands
are
annually
slau
ﬁtered
for
food
and
that
in
state
of
nature
an
equal
number
would
have
somehow
to
be
disposed
of
the
only
difference
between
organisms
which

or

by
the

this
difference
does
rot
determine
how
many

of
the
two
species
can
be
supported
in

large
number
of

is
of
some
importance
to
those
species
which
depend
on

fluctuating

of

them
rafpidl{
to
increase
in

but
the
real
importance
of
large
number
of
eggs
or
seeds
is
to
make
up
for
much
destruction
at
some
period
of
life
and
this
period
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
is
an
early
ome
if
an
animal
can
in
any
way
protect
its
own
eggs
or
young
small
number
may
be
produced
and
yet
the
average
stock
be
fully
kept
up
but
if
many
eggs
or
young
are
destroyed
many
must
be
produced
or
the
species
will
become
ex
tinet
it
would
suffice
to
keep
up
the
full
number
of
tree
which
lived
on
an
average
for
thousand
years
if
single
seed
were
produced
once
in
thousand
years
su
posing
that
this
seed
were
never
destroyed
and
could
be
ensured
to
germinate
in
fitting
place
~so
that
in
all
cases
the
average
number
of
any
animal
depends
only
indirectly
on
the
number
of
its
eggs
or
seeds
in
looking
at
nature
it
is
most
necessary
to
keep
the
foregoing
considerations
always
in
mind—never
to
forget
that
every
single
organic
being
around
us
may
be
sniﬁeto
be
striving
to
the
utmost
to

we

are

surprise
any

how

we
are
on

head
even
in

to

this
su{)liect
has
been
ably
treated
by
several
authors
and
shall
in
my
future
work
discuss
some
of
the
checks
at
considerable
length
more
especially
in
regard
to
the
feral
animals
of
south
america
here
will
make
only
few
remarks
just
to
recall
to
the
reader’s
mind
some
of
the
chief
points
eggs
or
very
young
animals
seem
generally
to
suffer
most
but
this
1s
not
invariably
the
case
ith
plants
there
is
vast
destruction
of
seeds
but
from
some
observations
which
have
made
believe
that
it
is
the
seedlings
which
suffer
most
from
germinating
in
ground
already
thickly
stocked
with
other
plants
seedlings
also
are
destroyed
in
vast
numbers
by
various
enemies
for
instance
on
piece
of
ground
three
feet
long
and
two
wide
dug
and
cleared
and
where
there
could
be
no
choking
from
other
plants
marked
all
the
seedlings
of
our
native
weeds
as
they
came
e
and
out
of
the
357
no
less
than
295
were
destroyed
chiefly
by
slugs
and
insects
if
turf
which
has
long
been
mown
and
the
case
would
be
the
same
with
turf
closely
browsed
by
quad;;luﬁeds
be
let
to
grow
the
more
vigorous
plants
gradually
kill
the
less
vigorous
though
fully
grown
plants
thus
out
of
twenty
species
growing
on
little
spot
of
turf
three
feet
by
four
nine
species
perished
from
the
other
species
being
allowed
to
grow
up
freely
the
amount
of
food
for
each
species
of
course
gives
the
extreme
limit
to
which
each
can
increase
but
very
frequently
it
is
not
the
obtaining
food
but
the
serving
as
grey
to
other
animals
which
determines
the
average
num
ers
of
species
thus
there
seems
to
be
little
doubt
that
cmar
itl
checks
to
increase
6t
the
stock
of
partridges
grouse
and
hares
on
anyl
estate
depends
chiefly
on
the
destruction
of
vermin
not
one
head
of
fame
were
shot
during
the
next
twenty
years
in
england
and
at
the
same
time
if
no
vermin
were
destroyed
there
would
in
all
probability
be
less
game
than
at
present
although
hundreds
of
thousands
of
eame
animals
are
now
annually
killed
on
the
other
and
in
some
cases
as
with
the
elephant
and
rhinoceros
none
are
destm{ed
by
beasts
of
prey
even
the
tiger
in
india
most
rarely
dares
to
attack
young
eléphant
pro
tected
by
its
dam
climate
plays
an
important
part
in
determining
the
average
numbers
of
species
and
periodical
seasons
of
extreme
cold
or
drought
believe
to
be
the
most
effective
of
all
checks
estimated
that
the
winter
of
1854-53
destroyed
four-fifths
of
the
birds
in
my
own
grounds
and
this
is
tremendous
destruction
when
we
remember
that
ten
per
cent.is
an
extraordinarily
severe
mortality
from
epidemics
with
man
the
action
of
climate
seems
at
first
sight
to
be
quite
independent
of
the
struggle
for
existence
but
in
so
far
as
climate
chiefly
acts
in
reducing
food
it
brings
on
the
most
severe
struggle
between
the
individuals
whether
of
the
same
or
of
distinct
species
which
subsist
on
the
same
kind
of
food
even
when
cli
mate
for
instance
extreme
cold
acts
directly
it
will
be
the
least
vigorous
or
those
which
have
got
least
food
through
the
advancing
winter
which
will
suffer
most
when
we
travel
from
south
to
north
or
from
dam
region
to
dry
we
invariably
see
some
species
graduall
getting
rarer
and
rarer
and
finally
disappearing
and
the
change
of
climate
being
conspicuous
we
are
tempted
to
attribute
the
whole
effect
to
its
direct
action
but
this
is
very
false
view
we
forget
that
each
species
even
where
it
most
abounds
is
constantly
suffering
enormous
destruction
at
some
period
of
its
life
from
enemies
or
from
competitors
for
the
same
place
and
food
and
if
these
enemies
or
competitors
be
in
the
least
degree
fa
voured
by
any
slight
change
of
climate
they
will
increase
in
numbers
and
as
each
area
is
already
fully
stocked
with
inhabitants
the
other
species
will
decreagse
when
68
ohecks
to
increase
cmar
nil
we
travel
southward
and
see
species
decreasing
in
numbers
we
may
feel
sure
that
the
cause
lies
quite
as
much
in
other
species
being
favoured
as
in
this
one
being
hurt
so
it
is
when
we
travel
northward
but
in
some
what
lesser
degree
for
the
number
of
species
of
all
kinds
and
therefore
of
competitors
decreases
northwards
hcuce
in
going
northward
or
in
ascending
mountain
we
far
oftener
meet
with
stunted
forms
due
to
the
diérectly
inju
rious
action
of
climate
than
we
do
in
proceeding
south
wards
or
in
descending
mountain
en
we
reach
the
arectic
regions
or
snow-capped
summits
or
absolate
des
erts
the
struggle
for
life
is
almost
exclusively
with
the
elements
that
climate
acts
in
main
part
indirectly
by
favouring
other
species
we
may
clearly
see
in
the
prodigious
num
ber
of
plants
in
our
gardens
which
can
perfectly
well
endure
our
climate
but
which
never
become
naturalised
for
they
cannot
compete
with
our
native
plants
nor
resist
destruction
by
our
native
animals
when
species
owing
to
highly
favourable
circum
stances
increases
inordinately
in
numbers
in
small
tract
epidemics—at
least
this
seems
generally
to
occur
with
our
game
animals—often
ensue
and
here
we
have
lim
iting
check
independent
of
the
struggle
for
life
but
even
some
of
these
so-called
epidemics
appear
to
be
due
to
parasitic
worms
which
have
from
some
cause
possibly
in-part
through
facility
of
diffusion
amongst
the
crowded
animals
been
disproportionably
favoured
and
here
comes
sort
of
struggle
between
the
parasite
and
its
prey
on
the
other
hand
in
many
cases
large
stock
of
individuals
of
the
same
species
relatively
to
the
numbers
of
its
enemies
is
absolutely
necessary
for
its
preservation
thus
we
can
easily
raise
plenty
of
corn
and
rape-seed
&c
in
our
fields
because
the
seeds
are
in
great
excess
compared
with
the
number
of
birds
which
feed
on
them
nor_can
the
bird
though
having
super-abundance
of
food
at
this
one
season
increase
in
number
roiortionally
to
the
supply
of
seed
as
their
numbers
are
checked
during
winter
ii?mt
any
one
who
has
tried
knows
how

69
plants
in

have
in
this
case
lost
every
single
seed
this
view
of
the
necessity
of
large
stock
of
the
same
species
for
its
preservation
explains
believe
some
singular
facts
in
nature
such
as
that
of
very
rare
plants
being
sometimes
extremeli
abundant
in
the
few
spots
where
they
do
occur
and
that
of
some
social
plants
being
social
that
is
abounding
in
individuals
even
on
the
ex
|treme
confines
of
their
range
for
in
such
cases
we
may
believe
that
plant
could
exist
only
where
the
conditions
of
its
life
were
so
favourable
that
many
could
exist
to
gether
and
thus
save
each
other
from
utter
destruction
should
add
that
the
good
effects
of
frequent
intercrossing
and
the
ill
effects
of
close
interbreeding
probably
come
into
plaiy
in
some
of
these
cases
but
on
this
intricate
subject
will
not
here
enlarge
any
cases
are
on
record
showing
how
complex
and
unexpected
are
the
checks
and
relations
between
organic
beings
which
have
to
struggle
together
in
the
same
country
will
give
only
single
instance
which
though
simple
one
has
interested
me
in
staﬁeordshire
on
tl%e
estate
of
relation
where
had
ample
means
of
investigation
there
was
large
and
extremely
barren
heath
which
had
never
been
touched
by
the
hand
of
man
but
several
hundred
acres
of
exactly
the
same
nature
had
been
enclosed
twenty-five
years
previously
and
planted
with
scotch
fir
the
change
in
the
native
vegetation
of
the
planted
part
of
the
heath
was
most
remarkable
more
than
is
generally
seen
in
passing
from
one
%uite
different
soil
to
another
not
only
the
propor
tional
numbers
of
the
heath
plants
were
wholly
changed
but
twelve
species
of
plants
not
counting
grasses
and
carices
flourished
in
the
plantations
which
could
not
be
found
on
the
heath
effect
on
the
insects
must
have
been
still
%‘reater
for
six
insectivorous
birds
were
very
common
in
the
plantations
which
were
not
to
be
seen
on
the
heath
and
the
heath
was
frequented
by
two
or
three
distinc
insectivorous
birds
ere
we
see
how
potent
has
been
the
effect
of
the
introduction
of
single
tree
nothing
whatever
else
having
been
done
with
the
exception
that
the
land
had
been
enclosed
so
that
cattle

but
how
important
an
element
enclosure
is
plainly
saw
near
farnham
in
surrey
here
thers
are
extensive
heaths
with
few
clumps
of
old
scotch
firs
on
the
distant
hill-tops
within
the
last

hen
ascertained
that
these
young
trees
had
not
been
sown
or
planted
was
so
much
surprised
at
their
numbers
that
went
to
several
points
of
view
whenece*i
could
examine
hundreds
of
acres
of
the
unenclosed
heath
and
literally
could
not
see
single
scotch
fir
except
the
old
planted
clumps
but
on
looking
closely
between
the
stems
of
the
heath
found
multitude
of
seedlings
and
little
trees
which
had
been
perpetually
browsed
down
by
the
cattle
in
one
square
ynrge
at
point
some
hundred
yards
distant
from
one
of
the
old
clumps
counted
thirty
two
little
trees
and
one
of
them
with
twenty-six
rings
of
growth
had
during
many
years
tried
to
raise
its
head
above
the
stems
of
the
heath
and
had
failed
no
wonder
that
as
soon
as
the
land
was
enclosed
it
became
thickly
clothed
with
vigorously
growing
young
firs
yet
the
heath
was
so
extremely
barren
and
so
cxtensive
that
no
one
would
ever
have
imagined
that
cattle
would
have
go
closely
and
effectually
searched
it
for
food
here
we
see
that
cattle
absolutely
determine
the
exist~
ence
of
the
scotch
fir
but
in
several
parts
of
the
world
insects
determine
the
existence
of
cattle
perhaps
para
guay
offers
the
most
curious
instance
of
this
for
here
neither
cattle
nor
horses
nor
dogs
have
ever
run
wild
though
they
swarm
southward
and
northward
in
feral
state
and
azara
and
rengger
have
shown
that
this
is
caused
by
the
greater
number
in
paraguay
of
certain
ﬂ{
which
lays
its
eggs
in
the
navels
of
these
animals
when
first
born
the
increase
of
these
flies
numerous
as
they
are
must
be
habitually
checked
by
some
means
robably
by
birds
hence
if
certain
insectivorous
birds
whose
numbers
are
probably
regulated
by
hawks
or
beasts
of
prey
were
to
increase
in
paraguay
the
flies
would
decrease—then
cattle
and
horses
would
become
feral
and
this
would
certainly
greatly
alter
as
indeed
cmar
iil}
mutual
ohecks
to
increasr
mn
have
observed
in
parts
of
south
america
the
vegetation
this
again
would
iargely
affect
the
insects
and
this
as
we
just
have
seen
in
staffordshire
the
insectivorous
birds
and
so
onwards
in
ever-increasing
circles
of
complexity
we
began
this
series
by
insectivorous
birds
and
we
have
ended
with
them
not
that
in
nature
the
relations
can
ever
be
as
simple
as
this
battle
within
battle
must
ever
be
recurring
with
varying
success
and
yet
in
the
long
run
the
forces
are
so
nicely
balanced
that
the
face
of
nature
remains
uniform
for
long
periods
of
time
though
assuredly
the
merest
trifle
would
often
give
the
victory
to
one
organic
being
over
another
nevertheless
so
pro
found
is
our
ignorance
and
so
high
our
presumption
that
we
marvel
when
we
hear
of
the
extinction
of
an
organic
being
and
as
we
do
not
see
the
cause
we
invoke
cata
clysms
to
desolate
the
world
or
invent
laws
on
the
dura
tion
of
the
forms
of
life
am
tempted
to
give
one
more
instance
showing
how
plants
and
animals
most
remote
in
the
scale
of
nature
are
bound
together
by
web
of
complex
relations
shall
hereafter
have
occasion
to
show
that
the
exotic
lobelia
fulgens
in
this
part
of
england
is
never
visited
by
in
sects
and
consequently
from
its
peculiar
structure
never
can
set
seed
many
of
our
orchidaceous
plants
abso
lutely
require
the
visits
of
moths
to
remove
their
pollen
masses
and
thus
to
fertilise
them
have
also
reason
to
believe
that
humble-bees
are
indispensable
to
the
fertilisa
tion
of
the
heartsease
g
iola
tricolor
for
other
bees
do
not
visit
this
flower
from
experiments
which
have
lately
tried
have
found
that
the
visits
of
bees
are
neces
sary
for
ﬂf
fertilisation
of
some
kinds
of
clover
for

20

humble-bees
alone
visit
red

as

bees
cannot
reach
the

tar
hence
have
very
little
doubt
that
if
the
whole
nus
of
humble-bees
became
extinct

the
heartsease

would

or

the
number
of
hnmble
bees
in
any
district
depends
in
great
degree
on
the
number
of
field-mice
which
destroy
their
combs
and
nests
and
mr
h
newman
who
has
long
attended
to
the
habits
of
humble-bees
believes
that
more
than
two
thirds
of
them
are
thus
destroyed
all
over
england
now
the
number
of
mice
is
largely
dependent
as
every
one
knows
on
the
number
of
cats
and
mr
newman
says
near
villages
and
small
towns
have
found
the
nests
of
humble-bees
more
numerous
than
elsewhere
which
attribute
to
the
number
of
cats
that
destroy
the
mice
hence
it
is
quite
creditable
that
the
presence
of
feline
animal
in
large
numbers
in
district
mifht
determine
through
the
intervention
first
of
mice
and
then
of
bees
the
frequency
of
certain
flowers
in
that
district
in
the
case
of
every
species
many
different
checks
acting
at
different
periods
of
life
and
during
different
seasons
or
years
probably
come
into
play
some
one
check
or
some
few
being
generally
the
most
potent
but
all
concurring
in
determining
the
average
number
or
even
the
existence
of
the
species
in
some
cases
it
can
be
shown
that
widely-different
checks
act
on
the
same
species
in
different
districts
when
we
look
at
the
plants
and
bushes
clothing
an
entangled
bank
we
are
tempted
to
attribute
their
progortional
numbers
and
kinds
to
what
we
call
chance
but
how
false
view
is
this
every
one
has
heard
that
when
an
american
forest
is
cut
down
very
different
vegetation
springs
up
but
it
has
been
observed
that
the
trees
now
growing
on
the
ancient
indian
mounds
in
the
southern
united
states
display

have
gone

what

between

with

of

striving

and
all
feeding
on

on

on

is
this

to
the
action
and

of
the
innumerable
plants

which
have
determined
in

of

of

now
growing

the
dependency
of
one
organic
being
on
another
as
of

on
its
prey
lies
generally
between
bein
remote
in
the
scale
of
nature
%l:u‘u
is
often
the
case
wi
those
which
may
strictly
be
said
to
struggle
with
each
other
for
existence
as
in
the
case
of
locusts
and
grass
feeding
quadrupeds
but
the
le
almost
invariably
will
be
most
severe
between
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
for
they
frequent
the
same
districts
require
the
same
food
and
are
exposed
to
the
same
dangers
in
the
case
of
varieties
of
the
same
species
the
struggle
will
generally
be
almost
equally
severe
and
we
sometimes
see
the
contest
soon
decided
for
instance
if
several
varieties
of
wheat
be
sown
together
and
the
mixed
seeds
be
re
sown
some
of
the
varieties
which
best
suit
the
soil
or
climate
or
are
naturally
the
most
fertile
will
beat
the
others
and
so
yield
more
seed
and
will
consequently
in
few
years
quite
supplant
the
other
varieties
to
keep
up
mixed
stock
of
even
such
extremely
close
varieties
as
the
variously
coloured
sweet-peas
they
must
be
each
year
harvested
separately
and
the
seed
then
mixed
in
due
pro
portion
otherwise
the
weaker
kinds
will
steadily
decrease
1n
numbers
and
disappear
so
again
with
the
varieties
of
sheep
it
has
been
asserted
that
certain
mountain
varieties
will
starve
out
other
mountain-varieties
so
that
they
cannot
be
kept
together
the
same
result
has
fol
lowed
from
keeping
together
different
varieties
of
the
medicinal
leech
it
may
even
be
doubted
whether
the
varieties
of
any
one
of
our
domestic
plants
or
animals
have
so
exactly
the
same
strength
habits
and
constitu
tion
that
the
original
proportions
of
mixed
stock
could
be
kept
up
for
half
dozen
ienerations
if
they
were
allowed
to
struggle
together
like
beings
in
state
of
nature
and
if
the
seed
or
young
were
not
annually
sorted
as
specinzs
of

usually
though
by

for

cuar
m1
no
means
invariably
some
similarity
in
habits
and
consti
tution
and
always
in
structure
the
struggle
will
generally
be
more
severe
between
species
of
the
same
genus
when
they
come
into
competition
with
each
other
than
between
species
of
distinct
genera
we
see
this
in
the
recent
ex
tension
over
parts
of
the
united
states
of
one
species
of
swallow
having
caused
the
decrease
of
another
species
the
recent
increase
of
the
missel-thrush
in
parts
of
scot
land
has
caused
the
decrease
of
the
song-thrush
how
frequently
we
hear
of
one
species
of
rat
taking
the
flace
of
another
spevies
under
the
most
different
climates
in
russia
the
small
asiatic
cockroach
has
everywhere
driven
before
it
its
great
congener
one
species
of
charlock
will
supplant
another
and
in
other
cases
we
can
dimly
see
why
the
competition
should
be
most
severe
between
allied
forms
which
fill
nearly
the
same
place
in
the
econo
my
of
nature
but
proba{ly
in
no
one
case
could
we
precisely
say
why
one
species
has
been
victorious
over
another
in
the
great
battle
of
life
corollary
of
the
highest
importance
may
be
deduced
from
the
foregoing
remarks
namely
that
the
structure
of
every
orstmic
eing
is
related
in
the
most
essential
yet
often
hidden
manner
to
that
of
all
other
organic
be
ings
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
for
food
or
resi
dence
or
from
which
it
has
to
escape
or
on
which
it
preys
this
is
obvious
in
the
structure
of
the
teeth
and
talons
of
the
tiger
and
in
that
of
the
legs
and
claws
of
the
parasite
which
clings
to
the
hair
on
the
tiger’s
body
but
in
the
beautifully
plumed
seed
of
the
dangelion
and
in
the
flattened
and
fringed
legs
of
the
water-beetle
the
relation
seems
at
first
confined
to
the
elements
of
air
and
water
yet
the
advantage
of
plumed
seeds
no
doubt
stands
in
the
closest
relation
to
the
land
being
already
thickly
clothed
by
other
plants
so
that
the
seeds
may
be
widely
distributed
and
faﬁ
on
unoccupied
ground
in
the
water-beetle
the
structure
of
its
legs
so
well
adapted
for
diving
allows
it
to
compete
with
other
aquatic
insects
to
hunt
for
its
own
prey
and
to
escape
serving
as
prey
to
other
animals
the
store
of
nutriment
laid
up
within
the
seeds
of
cmar
ixel
struggle
for
existence
ki
many
plants
seems
at
first
sight
to
have
no
sort
of
relation
to
other
plants
but
from
the
strong
growth
of
young
plants
produced
from
such
seeds
as
peas
and
beans
when
sown
in
the
midst
of
long
grass
suspect
that
the
chief
use
of
the
nutriment
in
510
seed
is
to
favour
the
growth
of
the
young
seedling
whilst
struggling
with
other
plants
g-rowmi
vigorously
all
around
look
at
plant
in
the
midst
of
its
m%fe
why
does
it
not
double
or
quadruple
its
numbers
know
that
it
can
perfectly
well
withstand
little
more
heat
or
cold
dampness
or
dryness
for
elsewhere
it
ranges
into
slightly
hotter
or
colder
damper
or
drier
districts
in
this
case
we
can
clearly
see
that
if
we
wished
in
imagination
to
give
the
plant
the
power
of
increasing
in
number
we
should
have
to
give
it
some
advantage
over
its
competi
tors
or
over
the
animals
which
preyed
on
it
on
the
confines
of
its
geographical
range
change
of
constitu
tion
with
respect
to
climate
would
clearly
be
an
advantage
to
our
plant
but
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
only
few
plants
or
animals
range
so
far
that
they
are
destroyed
by
fﬁe
rigour
of
the
climate
alone
not
until-we
reach
the
extreme
confines
of
life
in
the
arctic
regions
or
on
the
borders
of
an
utter
desert
will
competition
cease
the
land
may
be
extremely
cold
or
dry
yet
there
will
be
competition
between
some
few
species
or
between
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
for
the
warmest
or
damp
est
spots
ence
also
we
can
see
that
when
plant
or
animal
is
placed
in
new
country
amongst
new
competitors
though
the
climate
may
be
exactly
the
same
as
in
its
former
home
yet
the
conditions
of
its
life
will
generally
be
changed
in
an
essential
manner
if
we
wished
to
increase
its
avers
numbers
in
its
new
home
we
should
have
to
modify
it
in
different
way
to
what
we
should
have
done
in
its
native
country
for
we
should
have
to
give
it
some
advantage
over
different
set
of
competitors
or
enemies
it
is
good
thus
to
try
in
our
imagination
to
give
an
form
some
advantage
over
another
probably
in
no
single
instance
should
we
know
what
to
do
so
as
to
succeed

perhaps
we
see
in

we
shall
best
understand
the
probable
course
of

by
taking
the
case
of
country

ing
some
physical
change
for
instance
of
climate
proportional
numbers
of
its
inhabitants
would
almost
im
iately
undergo
change
and
some
species
might
be
come
extinct
may
conclude
from
what
we
have
seen
of
the
intimate
and
complex
manner
in
which
the
in
habitants
of
each
country
are
bound
together
that
any
change
in
the
numerical
proportions
of
some
of
the
in
habitants
independently
of
the
change
of
climate
itself
would
most
seriously
affect
many
of
the
others
if
the
country
were
open
on
its
borders
new
forms
would
cer
tainly
immigrate
and
this
also
would
seriously
disturb
the
relations
of
some
of
the
former
inhabitants
let
it
be
remembered
how
powerful
the
influence
of
single
intro

or
mamnmal
has
been
shownto
be
but
in
the
case
of
an
island,-or
of
country
partly
surrounded
by
barriers
into
which
new
and
better
adapted
forms
could
not
freely
enter
we
should
then
have
places
in
the
econo
my
of
nature
which
would
assuredly
be
better
filled
up
if
some
of
the
original
inhabitants
were
in
some
manner
modified
for
had
the
area
been
open
to
immigration
these

places
would
have
been
seized
on
by
intruders
in
such
case
every
slight
modification
which
in
the
course
of
ages
chanced
to
arise
and
which
in
any
way
favoured
the
individuals
of
any
of

species
by

conditions
would
tend
to
be
pre

and
natural

would
thus
have

have
reason
to
believe

and
in

foregoing
case
the

are
supposed
to
have
undergone

and
this
would
manifestly
be
favourable
to
natural
selection
by
giving
better
chance
of
profitable
variations
occurring
and
unless
profitable
variations
do
occur
natural
selection
can
do
nothing
not
that
as
believe
any
extreme
amount
of
variability
is
necessary
as
man
can
certainly
produce
great
results
by
adding
up
in
any
given
direction
mere
individual
differences
so
could
nature
but
far
more
easil{
from
having
incomparably
longer
time
at

dis
posal
nor
do
believe
that
any
great
physical
change
as
of
climate
or
any
unusual
degree
of
isolation
to
check
immigration
is
actually
necessary
to
produce
new

unoccupied
places
for

fill

modi

improving
some
of

extremely

much
8o
that
on

of

persons
are
warned
not
to

as

the
most

hence
pcan
see
no
reason
to
doubt
that
natural

might
be

effective
in
giving
the

in

ought
we
to
think
that
the

considered
by

as

of
the

yet
we
hear
from
an
excellent

that
in

smooth-skinned

suffer
far
more
from

purple

suffer

another

attacks

far
more
than
those
with

these

make
great

in

in

where
the

would
have
to

with

such

would
effectually
settle

should
succeed
in
looking
at

small
points
of

to

seem
to
be

we
must
not

no

affect

probably
in

of
those

the

so
conversely

in

probably

in

by

for

the

possessed
by

and
used
exclusively
for
opening
the
cocoon—or
the
hard

to
the

of

used
for

it
has

that
of
the

more
perish
in

than
are
able
to
get
out
of

so
that

assist
in

now
if
nature
had
to
make
the
beak
of

very
short
for
the
bird’s

the
process
of

would
be
very

and
there
would
be

within

as

the

fact
probably
occurs
under

and
if
so
natural

will
be
able
to
modify

in
its

to

or
in

to
wholly
different

of

in

as
is
sometimes
the
case
with
insects
and
this
leads
me
to
say
few
words
on
what
call
sexual

this
depends
not
on

for

but
on
stmﬁfle
between

for

of

the

is
not

sexual

less

than

generally

special

all
those
who
have

that
there
is
the

between

his

can
see
no

reason
to
doubt
that
female

by
selecting
during
thousands
of

the
most-melodious
or
beautiful
males
accordin
to
their
standard
of

might
produce

istrongly
suspect
that
some
well-known
laws
with
respect
to
the

of
male
and
female
birds
in
com
parison
with
the
1plumage
of
the
youn%
can
be
explained
on
the
view
of
plumage
having
been
chiefly
modified
by
sexual
selection
acting
when
the
birds
have
come
to
the
breeding
age
ot
during
the
breeding
season
the
modi
fications
thus
produced
being
inherited
at
corresponding
or
seasons
either
by
the
males
alone
or
by
the
males
and
females
but
have
not
space
here
to
enter
on
this
subject
thus
it
is
as
believe
that
when
the
males
and
females
of
any
animal
have
the
same
general
habits
of
life
but
differ
in
structure
colour
or
ornament
such
differ
ences
have
been
mainly
caused
by
sexual
selection
that
is
individual
males
have
had
in
successive
generations
some
slight
advantage
over
other
males
in
their
weapons
means
of
defence
or
charms
and
have
transmitted
these
advantages
to
their
male
offspring
yet
would
not
wish
to
attribute
all
such
sexual
differences
to
this
agen
cy
for
we
see
peculiarities
arising
and
becoming
attached
to
the
male
sex
in
our
domestic
animals
as
the
wattle
in
male
carriers
horn-like
protuberances
in
the
cocks
of
certain
fowls
&
which
we
cannot
believe
to
be
either
useful
to
the
males
in
battle
or
attractive
to
the
females
we
see
analogous
cases
under
nature
for
instance
the
tuft
of
hair
on
the
breast
of
the
turkey-cock
which
can
hardly
be
either
useful
or
ornamental
to
this
bird
in

had
the
tuft
appeared
under

it
would
have
been
called

t{
the

order
to
make
it
clear
how
as
believe
natural

acts
must
beg
permission
to
give
one
or
two
imaginary
illustrations
eet'us
take
the
case
of
wolf
which
preys
on
various
animals
securing
some
by
craft
some
by
strength
and
some
by
fleetnesa
and
let
us
suppose
that
86
natural

omar
iv
the
fleetest
prey
deer
for
instance
had
from
any
change
in
the
country
increased
in
numbers
or
that
other
prey
had
decreased
in
numbers
during
that
season
of
the
year
when
the
wolf
is
hardest
pressed
for
food
can
under
such
circumstances
see
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
swift
est
and
slimmest
wolves
would
have
the
best
chance
of
surviving
and
so
be
preserved
or
selected,—provided
always
that
they
retained
strenﬁth
to
master
their
prey
at
this
or
at
some
other
period
of
the
year
when
they
might
be
compelled
to
prcy
on
other
animals
can
see
no
more
reason
to
doubt
this
than
that
man
can
improve
the
fleetness
of
his
greyhounds
by
careful
and
methodical
selection
or
by
that
unconscious
selection
which
results
from
each
man
trying
to
keep
the
best
dogs
without
any
thought
of
modifying
the
breed
even
without
any
change
in
the
proportional
numbers
of
the
animals
on
which
our
wolf
preyed
cub
might
be
born
with
an
innate
tendency
to
pursue
certain
kinds
of
prey
nor
can
this
be
thought
very
improbable
for
we
often
observe
great
differences
in
the
natural
tenden
cies
of
our
domestic
animals
one
cat
for
instance
taking
to
catch
rats
another
mice
one
cat
according
to
mr
st
john
bringing
home
winged
game
another
hares
or
rab
bits
and
another
hunting
on
marshy
ground
and
almost
nightly
catching
woodcocks
or
snipes
the
tendency
to
catch
rats
rather
than
mice
is
known
to
be
inherited
now
if
any
slight
innate
change
of
habit
or
of
structure
henefited
an
individual
wolf
it
would
have
the
best
chance
of
surviving
and
of
leaving
offspring
some
of
its
young
would
%:obably
inherit
the
same
habits
or
structure
and
by
the
repetition
of
this
process
new
variety
might
be
formed
which
would
either
supplant
or
coexist
with
the
parent
form
of
wolf
or
again
the
wolves
inhabiting
mountainous
district
and
those
fre
3uenting
the
lowlands
would
naturally
be
forced
to
hunt
ifferent
prey
and
from
the
continued
preservation
of
the
individuals
best
fitted
for
the
two
sites
two
varieties
might
slowly
be
formed
these
varieties
would
cross
ang
blend
where
they
met
but
to
this
subject
of
inter
crossing
we
shall
soon
have
to
retwrn
may
add
that
omar
iv
natural

87
according
to
mr
pierce
there
are
two
varieties
of
the
wolf
inhabiting
the
catskill
mountains
in
the
united
states
one
with
light
greyhound-like
form
which
pur
sues
deer
and
the
other
more
bulky
with
shorter
legs
which
more
frequently
attacks
the
shepherd’s
flocks
let
us
now
take
more
complex
case
certain
plants
excrete
8weet
juice
apparently
for
the
sake
of
elimina
ting
something
injurious
from
their
sap
this
is
effected
by
glands
at
the
base
of
the
stipules
in
some
leguminose
and
at
the
beak
of
the
leaf
of
the
common
laurel
this
jjuice
though
small
in
quantity
is
greedily
sought
by
insects
let
us
now
suppose
little
sweet
juice
or
nectar
to
be
excreted
by
the
inner
bases
of
the
petals
of
flower
in
this
case
insects
in
seeking
the
nectar
would
get
dusted
with
pollen
and
would
certainly
often
transport
the
pollen
from
one
flower
to
the
sti
of
another
flower
the
flowers
of
two
distinct
individusls
of
the
same
species
would
thus
get
crossed
and
the
act
of
crossing
we
have
reason
to
believe
as
will
hereafter
be
more
full
alluded
to
would
groduce
very
vigorous
seedlings
whic
consequently
would
have
the
best
chance
of
flourishing
and
surviving
some
of
these
seedlings
would
probably
inherit
the
nectar-excreting
power
those
individual
flowers
which
had
the
largest
glands
or
nectaries
and
which
exereted
most
nectar
would
be
oftenest
visited
by
insects
and
would
be
oftenest
crossed
and
so
in
the
long
run
would
gain
the
upper
hand
those
flowers
also
which
had
their
stamens
and
pistils
placed
in
relation
to
the
size
and
habits
of
the
particular
insects
which
vis
ited
them
8o
as
to
favour
in
any
degree
the
transportal
of
their
pollen
from
flower
to
flower
would
likewise
be
favoured
or
selected
we
might
have
taken
the
case
of
insects
visiting
flowers
for
the
sake
of
collecting
pollen
instead
of
nectar
and
as
pollen
is
formed
for
the
sole
object
of
fertilisation
its
destruction
appears
simple
loss
to
the
plant
yet
if.a
little
pollen
were
carried
at
first
occasionally
and
then
habitually
by
the
pollen-devouring
insects
from
flower
to
flower
and
cross
thus
effected
although
nine-tenths
of
the
pollen
were
destroyed
it
might
still
be
great
gain
to
the
plant
and
those
individuals
88
natural
selection
{cxar
iv
which
produced
more
and
more
pollen
and
had
larger
and
larger
anthers
would
be
selected
when
our
plant
by
this
process
of
the
continued
pre
servation
or
natural
selection
of
more
and
more
attractive
flowers
had
been
rendered
highly
attractive
to
insects
they
would
unintentionlly
on
their
part
regularly
carry
en
from
flower
to
flower
and
that
they
can
most
effectually
do
this
could
easily
show
by
many
striking
instances
will
give
only
one—not
as
very
striking
case
but
as
likewise
illustrating
one
step
in
the
separation
of
the
sexes
of
plants
presently
to
be
alluded
to
some
holly-trees
bear
only
male
flowers
which
have
four
sta
mens
producing
rather
small
qua.ntit{
of
pollen
and
rudimentary
pistil
other
holly-trees
bear
only
female
flowers
these
have
full—sizedy
pistil
and
four
stamens
with
shrivelled
anthers
in
which
not
grain
of
pollen
can
be
detected
having
found
female
tree
exactly
sixty
yards
from
male
tree
put
the
stigmas
of
twenty
flowers
taken
from
different
branches
under
the
micro
scope
and
on
all
without
exception
there
were
pollen
erams
and
on
some
profusion
of
pollen
as
the
wind
ad
set
for
several
days
from
the
female
to
the
male
tree
the
pollen
could
not
thus
have
been
carried
the
weather
had
been
cold
and
boisterous
and
therefore
not
favourable
to
bees
nevertheless
every
female
flower
which
examined
had
been
effectnally
fertilised
by
the
bees
accidentally
dusted
with
%ollen
having
flown
from
tree
to
tree
in
search
of
nectar
but
to
return
to
our
imaginary
case
as
soon
as
the
plant
had
been
rendered
so
highly
attractive
to
insects
that
pollen
was
regularly
carried
g‘om
flower
to
flower
another
process
might
commence
no
naturalist
doubts
the
advantage
of
what
has
been
called
the
phy
siological
division
of
labour
;
hence
we
may
believe
that
it
would
be
advantageous
to
plant
to
produce
stamens
alone
in
one
flower
or
on
one
whole
plant
and
yistils
alone
in
another
flower
or
on
another
plant
in
plants
under
culture
and
placed
under
new
conditions
of
life
sometimes
the
male
organs
and
sometimes
the
female
orslans
become
more
or
less
impotent
now
if
we
suppose
this
to
occur
in
ever
so
slight
degree
under
nature
then
as
pollen
is
cmar
iv
natural
belection
89
already
carried
regularly
from
flower
to
flower
and
as
more
complete
separation
of
the
sexes
of
our
plant
would
be
advantageous
on
the
principle
of
the
division
of
labour
individuals
with
this
tendency
more
and
more
increased
would
be
continually
favoured
or
selected
until
at
last
complete
separation
of
the
sexes
would
be
effected
us
now
turn
to
the
nectar-feeding
insects
in
our
jmaginary
case
we
may
suppose
the
plant
of
which
we
have
been
slowly
increasing
the
nectar
by
continued
selec
tion
to
be
common
plant
and
that
certain
insects
de
pended
in
main
part
on
its
nectar
for
food
could
give
many
facts
showing
how
anxious
bees
are
to
save
time
for
instance
their
habit
of
cutting
holes
and
sucking
the
nectar
at
the
bases
of
certain
flowers
which
they
can
with
very
little
more
trouble
enter
by
the
mouth
bearing
such
facts
in
mind
can
see
no
reason
to
doubt
that
an
accidental
deviation
in
the
size
and
form
of
the
body
or
in
the
curvature
and
len%h
of
the
proboscis
&e
far
too
slight
to
be
appreciated
by
us
might
profit
bee
or
other
insects
so
that
an
individual
so
characterised
would
be
able
to
obtain
its
food
more
quickly
and
so
have
better
chance
of
living
and
leaving
descendants
its
descendants
would
probab%y
inherit
tendency
to
similar
slight
deviation
of
structure
the
tubes
of
the
corollas
of
the
common
red
and
incarnate
clovers
trifo
lium
pratense
and
incarnatum
do
not
on
hasty
glance
appear
to
differ
in
length
yet
the
hive-bee
can
easily
suck
the
nectar
out
of
the
incarnate
clover
but
not
out
of
the
common
red
clover
which
is
visited
by
humble
bees
alone
so
that
whole
fields
of
the
red
clover
offer
in
vain
an
abundant
supply-of
precious
nectar
to
the
hive
bee
thus
it
might
be
great
advantage
to
the
hive-bee
to
have
slightly
longer
or
differently
constructed
pro
boscis
on
the
other
%nmd
have
found
by
experiment
that
the
fertility
of
clover
greatly
depends
on
bees
visiting
and
moving
parts
of
the
corolla
so
as
to
push
the
pollen
on
to
the
stigmatic
surface
hence
again
if
humble-bees
were
to
become
rare
in
any
country
it
might
be
great
advantage
to
the
red
clover
to
have
shorter
or
more
deeply
divided
tube
to
its
corolla
so
that
the
hive-bee
90
on
the
advantage
cuar
£v
could
visit
its
flowers
thus
can
understand
how
flower
and
bee
might
slowly
become
either
simulta
neously
or
one
after
the
other
modified
and
adapted
in
the
most
perfect
manner
to
each
other
by
the
continued
reservation
of
individuals
presenting
mutual
and
slightly
avourable
deviations
of
structure
am
well
aware
that
this
doctrine
of
natural
selection
exemplified
in
the
above
imaginary
instances
is
open
to
the
same
objections
which
were
at
first
urged
against
sir
charles
lyell’s
noble
views
on
the
modern
changes
of
the
earth
as
illustrative
of
geology
;
but
we
now
very
seldom
hear
the
action
for
instance
of
the
coast-waves
called
trifling
and
insignificant
cause
when
applied
to
the
excavation
of
gigantic
valleys
or
to
the
formation
of
the
longest
lines
of
inland
cliffs
natural
selection
can
act
onl{
by
the
preservation
and
accumulation
of
infini
tesimally
small
inherited
modifications
each
profitable
to
the
preserved
being
and
as
modern
geology
has
almost
banished
such
views
as
the
excavation
of
great
valley
by
single
diluvial
wave
so
will
natural
selection
if
it
be
true
principle
banish
the
belief
of
the
continued
crea
tion
of
new
organic
beings
or
of
any
great
and
sudden
modification
in
their
structure
on
the
intercrossing
of
individuals.—i
must
here
in
troduce
short
digression
in
the
case
of
animals
and
lants
with
separated
sexes
it
is
of
course
obvious
that
two
individuals
must
always
with
the
exception
of
the
curious
and
not
well-understood
cases
of
parthenogenesis
unite
for
each
birth
but
in
the
case
of
eermaphrodite'a
this
is
far
from
obvious
nevertheless
am
strongly
inclined
to
be
lieve
that
with
all
hermaphrodites
two
individuals
either
occasionally
or
habitually
concur
for
the
reproduction
of
their
kind
this
view
was
first
suggested
by
andrew
knight
we
shall
presently
see
its
importance
but
must
here
treat
the
subject
with
extreme
brevity
though
have
the
materials
prepared
for
an
ample
discussion
all
vertebrate
animals
all
insects
and
some
other
large
eroups
of
animals
pair
for
each
birth
modern
research
as
much
diminished
the
number
of
supposed
hermaphro
dites
and
of
real
hermaphrodites
large
number
pair
cuar
iv
of
interorossing
01
that
is
two
individuals
regularly
unite
for
reproduction
which
is
all
that
concerns
us
but
still
there
are
many
hermaphrodite
animals
which
certainly
do
not
habitually
air
and
vast
majority
of
plants
are
hermaphrodites
that
reason
it
may
be
asked
is
there
for
supposing
in
these
cases
that
two
individuals
ever
concur
in
reproﬁuc
tion
as
it
is
impossible
here
to
enter
on
details
must
trust
to
some
general
considerations
alone
in
the
first
place
have
collected
so
large
body
of
facts
showing
in
accordance
with
the
almost
universal
belief
of
breeders
that
with
animals
and
plants
cross
between
different
varieties
or
between
individuals
of
the
same
variety
but
of
another
strain
gives
vigour
and
fer
tility
to-the
offspring
and
on
the
other
hand
that
closs
interbreeding
diminishes
vigour
and
fertility
that
these
facts
alone
incline
me
to
believe
that
it
is
general
law
of
nature
utterly
ignorant
though
we
be
of
the
meaning
of
the
law
that
no
organic
being
fertilizes
itself
for
an
eternity
of
generations
but
that
cross
with
another
in
dividual
is
occasionally—perhaps
at
very
long
intervals
indispensable
on
the
belief
that
this
is
law
of
nature
we
can
think
understand
several
large
classes
of
facts
such
as
the
following
which
on
any
other
view
are
inexplicable
every
hybridizer
knows
how
unfavourable
exposure
to
wet
18
to
the
fertilisation
of
flower
yet
what
multi
tude
of
flowers
have
their
anthers
and
stigmas
fully
ex
posed
to
the
weather
but
if
an
occasional
cross
be
indis
ensable
the
fullest
freedom
for
the
entrance
of
pollen
e‘om
another
individual
will
explain
this
state
of
expo
sure
more
especially
as
the
plant’s
own
anthers
and
pistil
genemll{msts.nd
so
close
together
that
self-fertilisation
seems
almost
inevitable
many
flowers
on
the
other
hand
have
their
organs
of
fructification
cioselg
enclosed
as
in
the
great
pa%
ionaceous
or
pea-family
but
in
sev
eral
perhaps
in
all
such
flowers
there
is
very
curious
adaptation
between
the
structure
of
the
flower
and
the
manner
in
which
bees
suck
the
nectar
for
in
doing
this
they
either
push
the
flower’s
own
pollen
on
the
stigma
or
bring
pollen
from
another
flower
so
necessary
are
992
on
the
advantage
{caur
iv
the
visits
of
bees
to
papilionaceous
flowers
that
have
found
by
experiments
published
elsewhere
that
their
fertility
is
greatly
diminished
if
these
visits
be
prevented
now
1t
is
scarcely
possible
that
bees
should
fly
from
flower
to
flower
and
not
carry
pollen
from
one
to
the
other
to
the
great
%ood
as
believe
of
the
plant
bees
will
act
like
camel-hair
pencil
and
it
is
quite
sufficient
just
to
touch
the
anthers
of
one
flower
and
then
the
stig
ma
of
another
with
the
same
brush
to
ensure
fertilisation
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
bees
would
thus
pro
duce
multitude
of
hybrids
between
distinct
species
for
if
you
bring
on
the
same
brush
plant’s
own
pollen
and
pollen
from
another
species
the
former
will
have
such
prepotent
effect
that
it
will
invariably
and
com
gletely
destroy
as
has
been
shown
by
girtner
any
in
uence
from
the
foreign
pollen
when
the
stamens
of
flower
suddenly
spring
towards
the
pistil
or
slowly
move
one
after
the
other
towards
it
the
contrivance
seems
adapted
solely
to
ensure
self-fertili
sation
and
no
doubt
it
is
useful
for
this
end
but
the
agency
of
insects
is
often
required
to
cause
the
stamens
to
sﬁ)nng
forward
as
kolreuter
has
shown
to
be
the
case
with
the
barberry
and
curiously
in
this
very
genus
which
seems
to
have
special
contrivance
for
self-fertilisation
it
is
well
known
that
if
very
closely-allied
forms
or
varie
ties
are
planted
near
each
other
it
is
hardly
possible
to
raise
pure
seedlings
so
largely
do'they
naturally
cross
in
many
other
cases
far
from
there
being
any
aids
for
self-fertilisation
there
are
special
contrivances
as
could
show
from
the
writings
of
c
sprengel
and
from
my
own
observations
which
effectually
prevent
the
stigma
receiving
pollen
from
its
own
flower
for
instance
in
lobelia
fulgens
there
is
really
beautiful
and
elaborate
contrivance
by
which
every
one
of
the
infinitely
numer
ous
pollen-granules
are
swept
out
of
the
conjoined
anthers
of
each
flower
before
the
stigma
of
that
individual
flower
is
ready
to
receive
them
and
as
this
flower
is
never
visited
at
least
in
my
garden
by
insects
it
never
sets
seed
though
by
placing
pollen
from
one
flower
on
the
stigma
of
another
raised
plenty
of
seedlings
and
whilst
omar
iv
of
intercrossing
93
another
species
of
lobelia
growing
close
by
which
is
visited
by
bees
seeds
freely
in
very
many
other
cases
though
tﬂere
be
no
special
mechanical
contrivance
to
pre
vent
the
stigma
of
flower
receiving
its
own
pollen
yet
as
c
c
sprengel
has
shown
and
as
can
confirm
either
the
anthers
burst
before
the
stigma
is
ready
for
fertilisation
or
the
stigma
is
ready
before
the
pollen
of
that
flower
is
ready
so
that
these
plants
have
in
fact
separated
scxes
and
must
habitually
be
crossed
how
strange
arc
these
facts
how
strange
that
the
pollen
and
stigmatic
surface
of
the
same
flower
though
placed
so
close
together
as
if
for
the
very
purpose
of
self-fertilisation
should
in
so
many
cases
bo
mutually
useless
to
each
other
how
simply
are
these
facts
explained
on
the
view
of
an
occasional
cross
with
distinet
individual
being
advantageous
or
in
dispensable
if
several
varieties
of
the
cabbage
radish
onion
and
of
some
other
plants
be
allowed
to
seed
near
each
other
large
majority
as
have
found
of
the
seedlings
thus
raised
will
turn
out
mongrels
for
instance
raised
233
seedling
cabbages
from
some
dpla.nts
of
different
varieties
growing
near
each
other
and
of
these
only
78
were
true
to
their
kind
and
some
even
of
these
were
not
perfectly
true
yet
the
pistil
of
each
cabbage-flower
is
surrounded
not
only
by
its
own
six
stamens
but
by
those
of
the
man
other
flowers
on
the
same
plant
how
then
comes
1t
that
such
vast
number
of
the
seedlings
are
mongrelized
suspect
that
it
must
arise
from
the
pollen
of
distinct
wvartety
having
prepotent
effect
over
flower’s
own
ollen
and
that
this
is
part
of
the
general
law
of
good
eing
derived
from
the
intercrossing
of
distinct
individuals
of
the
same
species
when
distinct
species
are
crossed
the
case
is
directly
the
reverse
for
plant’s
own
pollen
is
alwa.l)]’s
prepotent
over
foreign
pollen
but
to
this
subject
we
shall
return
in
future
chapter
in
the
case
of
gigantic
tree
covered
with
innumera
ble
flowers
it
may
be
objected
that
pollen
could
seldom
be
carried
from
tree
to
tree
and
at
most
only
from
flower
to
flower
on
the
same
tree
and
that
flowers
on
the
same
tree
can
be
considered
as
distinct
individuals
only
in
04
on
the
advantage
cmar
iv
limited
sense
believe
this
objection
to
be
valid
but
that
nature
has
largely
provided
a%gninst
it
by
giving
to
trees
strong
tendency
to
bear
flowers
with
separated
sexes
when
the
sexes
are
separated
although
the
male
and
female
flowers
may
be
produced
on
the
same
tree
we
can
see
that
pollen
must
be
regularly
carried
from
flower
to
flower
and
this
will
give
better
chance
of
pollen
being
occasionally
carried
from
tree
to
tree
that
trees
belonging
to
all
orders
have
their
sexes
more
often
sepa
rated
than
other
plants
find
to
be
the
case
in
this
coun
try
and
at
my
request
dr
hooker
tabulated
the
trees
of
new
zealand
and
dr
asa
gray
those
of
the
united
states
and
the
result
was
as
anticipated
on
the
other
hand
dr
hooker
has
recently
informed
me
that
he
finds
that
the
rule
does
not
hold
in
australia
and
have
made
these
few
remarks
on
the
sexes
of
trees
simply
to
call
at
tention
to
the
subject
turning
for
very
brief
space
to
animals
on
the
land
there

will
give
time
for
any

and
this
may
some
times
be
of
importance
in
the
production
of

if
however
an
isolated
area
be
very
small
either
from
being
surrounded
by
barriers
or
from
having
very
peculiar
physical
conditions
the
total
number
of
the
individuals
supported
on
it
will
necessarily
be
very
small
and
few
ness
of
individuals
will
greatly
retard
the
production
of
new
species
through
natural
selection
by
decreasing
the
chance
of
the
appearance
of
favourable
variations
if
we
turn
to
nature
to
test
the
truth
of
these
remarks
and
look
at
any
small
isolated
area
such
as
an
oceanic
island
although
the
total
number
of
the
species
inhabit
ing
it
will
be
found
to
be
small
as
we
shall
see
in
our
chapter
on
geographical
distribution
yet
of
these
species
very
large
proportion
are
endemic,—that
is
have
been
produced
there
and
nowhere

hence
an
oceanic
isl
and
at
first
sight
seems
to
have
been
highly
favourable
for
the
froduction
of
new
species
but
we
may
thus
greatly
deceive
ourselves
for
to
ascertain
whether
small
isolated
area
or
large
open
area
like
continent
has
been
most
favourable
for
the
production
of
new
organic
forms
we
ought
to
make
the
comparison
within
equal
times
and
this
we
are
incapable
of
doing
although
do
not
doubt
that
isolation
is
of
considera
ble
importance
in
the
production
of
new
species
on
the
whole
am
inclined
to
believe
that

of

especially
in
the

there
be

supported

the

complex
from
the

ber
of

;
and
if
some
of

others
will
have
to
be
improved
in

degree
or
they

also
as
soon
as
it
has
been

be
able

thus
come
into

with

the

to

them
will
be
more
severe

than
on

moreover
great
areas
though
now
continuous

will
often
have

so
that
the
good
effects

will
§enerally
to

have
concurred
finall{
conclude
that
although
small
isolated
areas
probably
have
been
in
some
respects
highly
favourable
for
the
pro
duction
of
new
species
yet
that
the
course
of
modification
will
generally
have
been
more
rapid
on
large
areas
and
what
is
more
important
that
the
new
forms
produced
on
large
areas
which
already
have
been
victorious
over
many
competitors
will
be
those
that
will
spread
most
widely
will
give
rise
to
most
new
varieties
and
species
and
will
thus
play
an
im‘{;ortant
part
in
the
changing
his
tory
of
the
organic
world
we_
can
perhaps
on
these
views
understand
some
facts
which
will
be
again
alluded
to
in
our
chapter
on
geographical
distribution
for
instance
that
the
produc

of
the
smaller
continent
of
australia
have
formerly
yielded
and
apparently
are
now
yielding
before
those
of
the
larger
europmo-asiatic
area
thus
also
it
is
that
continental
productions
have
everywhere
becomeso
largely
naturalised
on

on

island
the
race
for
life
will
have
been
less
severe
and
there
will
have
been
less
modification
and
less

hence
perhaps
1t
comes
that

and
consequently
the
competition
between
fresh-water
productions
will
have
been
less
severe
than
elsewhere
new
forms
will
have
been
more
slowly
formed
and
old
forms
more
slowly
ex

it
is
in

that
we
find
seven

in

we
find
some
of

which

extinction
omr
iv
in
our
chapter
on
geology
but
it
must
be
here
alluded
to
from
being
intimately
connected
with
natural
selection
natural
selection
acts
solely
through
the
preservation
of
variations
in
some
way
advantageous
which
consequently
endure
but
as
from
the
high
geometrical
powers
of
in
crease
of
all
organic
beings
each
area
is
already
fully
stocked
with
inhabitants
it
follows
that
as
each
selected
and
favoured
form
increases
in
number
so
will
the
less
favoured
forms
decrease
and
become
rare
rarity
as
geology
tells
us
is
the
precursor
to
extinction
we
can
also
see
that
any
form
represented
by
few
individuals
will
during
fluctuations
in
the
seasons
or
in
the
number
of
its
enemies
run
good
chance
of
utter
extinction
but
we
may
go
further
than
this
for
as
new
forms
are
con
tinually
and
slowly
being
produced
unless
we
believe
that
the
number
of
specific
forms
goes
on
perpetually
and
almost
indefinitely
increasing
numbers
inevitably
must
become
extinct
%’hat
the
number
of
specific
forms
has
not
indefinitely
increased
geology
shows
us
plainly
and
indeed
we
can
see
reason
why
they
should
not
have
thus
increased
for
the
number
of
places
in
the
polity
of
nature
is
not
indefinitely
great,—mot
that
we
have
any
means
of
knowing
that
any
one
refion

as

got
its
maxi
mum

probably
no
region
is
as

fully

cape
of

hope
where
more
species
of
tplamt:s
are
crowded
together
than
in
any
other
quarter
of
the
world
some
foreign
plants
have
become
naturalised
without
causing
as
far
as
we
know
the
ex
tinction
of
any
natives
furthermore
the
species
which
are
most
numerous
in
individuals
will
have
the
best
chance
of
producing
within
any
given
period
favourable
variations
we
have
evi
dence
of
this
in
the

in

that

that

the

and
we
have
seen
in

chapter
on
the
struggle
for

that
it
is
the
most
closely-allied
forms,—varieties
of
the

of

from

generally
come
into

with

consequently
each

during

will
generally
press

though

varieties

how
then
does
the

into
the
greater

between

at
this
does

mere
chance
as
we
may

it
might
cause
one
variet
to
differ
in

character
from
its

and
the
off
spring
of
this
variety
again-to
differ
from
its

in
the
very

character
and
in
greater
degree
but
this
alone
would
never
account
for
so
habitual
and
large
an
amount
of
difference
as
that
between
varieties
of
the
same
species
and
specics
of
the
same
genus
as
has
always
been
my
practice
let
us
seck
light
on
this
head
from
our
domestic
productions
we
shall
here
find
something
analogous

but
like

they
both
go

as
has

with

choosing

breeding
from
birds
with
longer

or
with

again
we
may
suppose
that
at
an
early
period
one
man
erefen'ed
swifter
horses
another
stronger
and
more
bulky
orses
the
early
differences
would
be
very
slight
in
the
course
of
time
from
the
continual
selection
of
swifter
horses
by
some
breeders
and
of
stronger
ones
by
others
the
differences
would
become
greater
and
would
be
noted
as
forming
two
sub-breeds
finally
after
the
lapse
of
cen
turies
the
sub-brecds
would
become
converted
into
two
well-established
and
distinct
breeds
as
the
differences
slowly
become
greater
the
inferior
animals
with
interne
diate
characters
being
neither
very
swift
nor
very
strong
will
have
been
neglected
and
will
have
tended
to
disap
pear
here
then
we
see
in
man’s
productions
the
action
of
what
may
be
called
the
principle
of
divergence
causing
differences
at
first
barely
appreciable
steadily
to
in
crease
and
the
breeds
to
diverge
in
character
both
from
each
other
and
from
their
common
parent
but
how
it
may
be
asked
can
any
analogous
princi
ple
apply
in
nature
believe
it
can
and
does
apply
most
efficiently
from
the
simple
circumstance
that
the
more
diversified
the
descendants
from
any
one
species
cmur
iv
divergence
of

105
become
in
structure
constitution
and
habits
by
so
much
will
they
be
better
cnebled
to
seize
on
many
and
widely
diversified
places
in
the
polity
of
nature
and
so
be
enabled
to
increase
in
numbers
we
can
clearly
see
this
in
thc
case
of
animals
with
simple
habits
take
the
case
of
carnivorous
quadruped
of
which
the
number
that
can
be
supported
in
any
coun
try
has
long
ago
arrived
at
its
full
average
if
its
natu
ral
powers
of
increase
be
allowed
to
act
it
can
succeed
in
increasing
the
conntry
not
undergoing
any
change
in
its
conditions
only
by
its
varying
descendants
seizing
on
places
at
present
occnpied
by
other
animals
some
of
them
for
instance
being
enabled
to
feed
on
new
kinds
of
prey
either
dead
or
alive
some
inhabiting
new
sta
tions
climbing
trees
frequenting
water
and
some
per
haps
becoming
less
carnivorous
the
more
diversified
in
xagits
and
structure
the
descendants
of
our
carnivorous
animal
became
the
more
places
they
would
be
enabled
to
occupy
what
apfliea
to
one
animal
will
apply
through
out
all
time
to
all
animals—that
is
if
they
vary—%or
otherwise
natural
selection
can
do
nothing
so
it
will
be
with
plants
it
has
been
cxg:arimentally
proved
that
if
plot
of
ground
be
sown
with
one
species
of
grass
and
similar
plot
be
sown
with
several
distinct
genera
of
grasses
greater
number
of
plants
and
greater
weight
of
dry
herbage
can
thus
be
raised
the
same
has
been
found
to
hold
good
when
first
one
variety
and
then
sever
al
mixed
varieties
of
wheat
have
been
sown
on
equal
spaces
of
ground
hence
if
any
one
species
of
grass
were
to
on
varying
and
those
varieties
were
continually
selected
which
differed
from
each
other
in
at
all
the
same
manner
as
distinet
species
and
genera
of
grasses
differ
from
each
other
greater
number
of
individual
plants
of
this
species
of
grass
including
its
modified
descendants
woulé
succeed
in
living
on
the
same
piece
of
ground
and
we
well
know
that
each
species
and
each
variety
of
grass
is
annually
sowing
almost
countless
seeds
and
thus
as
it
may
be
said
is
striving
its
utmost
to
increase
its
numbers
consequently
cannot
doubt
that
in
the
course
of
many
thousands
of
generations
the
most
distinct
varieties
of
any
106
natural
sbelection
ome
iv
one
species
of
grass
would
always
have
the
best
chance
of
succeeding
and
of
increasing
in
numbers
and
thus
of
supplanting
the
less
distinct
varieties
and
varieties
when
rendered
very
distinct
from
each
other
take
the
rank
of
species
the
truth
of
the
principle
that
the
greatest
amount
of
life
can
be
supporte&
by
great
diversification
of
structure
is
seen
under
many
natural
circumstances
in
an
ex
tremely
small
ares
especially
if
freely
open
to
immigra
tion
and
where
the
contest
between
individual
and
indi
vidual
must
be
severe
we
always
find
great
diversity
in
its
inhabitants
for
instance
found
that
piece
of
turf
three
feet
by
four
in
size
which
had
been
exposed
for
many
years
to
exactly
the
same
conditions
supported
twenty
species
of
plants
and
these
belonged
to
eighteen
genera
and
to
eight
orders
which
shows
how
much
these
plants
differ
from
each
other
so
it
is
with
the
plants
and
insects
on
small
and
uniform
islets
and
so
in
small
ponds
of
fresh
water
farmers
find
that
they
can
raise
most
food
by
rotation
of
plants
belonging
to
the
most
different
orders
nature
follows
what
may
be
called
simultaneous
rotation
most
of
the
animals
and
plants
which
live
close
round
any
small
piece
of
ground
could
live
on
it
supposing
it
not
to
be
in
any
way
glecnlinr
in
its
nature
and
may
be
said
to
be
striving
to
the
utmost
to
live
there
but
it
is
seen
that
where
they
come
into
the
closest
competition
with
each
other
the
advantages
of
diversification
of
structure
with
the
accompanying
differences
of
habit
and
constitution
determine
that
the
inhabitants
which
thus
jostle
each
other
most
closely
shall
as
a_general
rule
belong
to
what
we
call
different
genera
and
orders
the
same
principle
is
seen
in
the
naturalisation
of
lants
through
man’s
agency
in
foreiin
lands
it
might
have
been
expected
that
the
plants
which
have
succeeded
in
becoming
naturalised
in
any
land
would
generally
have
/
been
closely

to
the

260

we
can
gain
some
crude
idea
in
what
manner
some
of
the
natives
would
have
had
to
be
modified
in
order
to
have
gained
an
advantage
over
the
other
natives
and
we
may
think
at
least
safely
infer
that
diversification
of
structure
amounting
to
new
generic
differences
would
have
been
profitable
to
them
the
advantage
of
diversification
in
the
inhabitants
of
the

region
is
in
fact
the
same
as
that
of
the

in

the

the

in

see
the
process
of

in
an
early
and
incomplete
stage
of
development
after
the
foregoing
discussion
which
ought
to
have

we
may

assume
that

they

these

must
here
remark
that

from
thinking
that

the

this

as

the

can
be

these

and
might
have
been
inserted
anywhere
after

long
enough
to
have
allowed
the

of
considerable
amount
of

as
all
the

of
the

made
their

successful
in

they
will
generally
go
on
multi
plying
in

as
well
as
diverging

this
represented
in

the

from
the

highly

this
is
represented
in
the
diagram
by
some
of
the
lower

not
reaching
to
the

in
some
cases
do
not
doubt
that
the
process
of
modification
omr
iv

111
will
be
confined
to
single

of

and
the

will
not
be
increased
although
the
amount
of

have
been

this

would
be

in

if
all

removed

that
from

in
the

way
for

the
english
race-horse
and
english

have
apparently
both
gone
on
slowly
diverging
in

from
their
original
stocks
without
either
having
given
off
any
fresh
branches
or
races
after
ten

species

supposed
to
have
produced
three
forms
a

m
which
from
having
diverged
in
character
during
the
successive

will
have
come
to
differ
largely
but
perhaps
unequally
from
each
other
and
from
their
common
parent
if
we
suppose
the
amount
of
change
between
each
hori
zontal
line
in
our
diagram
to
be
excessively
small
these
three
forms
may
only
still
be
well-marked
varieties
or
they
may
have
arrived
at
the
doubtful
category
of
sub
species
but
we
have
only
to
suppose
the
steps
in
the
rocess
of
modification
to
be
more
numerous
or
greater
in
amount
to
convert
these
three
forms
into
well-defined
ecies
thus
the
diagram
illustrates
the
steps
by
which
ee
small
differences
distinguishing
varieties
are
increased
into
the
larger
differences
distinguishing
species
by
con
tinuing
the

for

shown

we

thus
as
believe

it
is
probable
that
more
than

species

have
assumed
that

hence
in

i]imve
chosen
the

the

this
is

not

but
during

another
of
our
principles
namely
that

will
have
played
an
important

natural
selection
necessarily
acts
by
the
selected
form
having
some
advantage
in
the
struggle
for
life
over
other
forms
there
will
be
constant
tendency
in
the
improved
descendants
of
any
one
species
to
supplant
and
exterminate
in
each
stage
of
descent
their
predecessors
and
their
original
parent
for
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
competition
will
generally
be
most
severe
between
those
forms
which
are
most
nearly
related
to
each
other
in
habits
constitution

hence
all
the
intermediate

between
the

that

between
the
less

more
improved
state
of
species
as
well
as
the
original
parent-species
itself
will
generally
tend
to
become
extinct
so
it
probabl
will
be
with
many
whole

lines
of

whic
will
be
conquered
by

the

quite

both

we

the

bring
some

we

when

have
to
refer
again
to
this

think
we
shall
then
see
that
the

throws

the

which
though

with
those
now

yet
are
often
in
some
degree

we
can
understand
this
fact
for
the
extinct
species
lived
at
very
ancient
epochs
when
the
branching
lines
of

had
diverged
less
see
no
reason
to
limit
the
process
of
modification
as
now
explained

alone
if
in

we
suppose
the

we
shall
also

very

descended
from

and
as
these
latter
two
genera
oth
from
continued
divergence
of
character
and
from
inheritance
from

parent
will
differ
widely
from
the
three
genera
descended
from

the
two
little
groups
of

will
form
two
distinct
families
or

according
to
the
amount
of

supposed
to
be

in

diagram
and
the
two
new
families
or
orders
will
have
descended
from
two
spe
cies
of
the
original
genus
and
these
two
species
are
sup
posed
to
have
descended
from
one
species
of
still
more
ancient
and
unknown
genus
we
have
seen
that
in

it
is
the
species
of
the
larger

this
indeed

in

it

all
trying
to
increase
in

one
large
group
will
slowly
conquer
another
large
group
reduce
its
numbers
and
thus
lessen
its
chance
for
further
variation
and
improvement
within
the

the

and
more
highly
perfected
sub

out
and
seizing

the

and
sub-groups
will
nally
tend
to

looking
to
the
future
we
can
redict
that
the
groups
of
organic
beings
which
are
now

and
triumphant
and
which
are

broken
ﬁi
that
is
which
as
yet
have
suffered

extinction
for
long
period
continue
to
increase
but
which
groups
will
ultimately
prevail
no
man
can
predict
for
we
well
know
that
many
groups
formerly
most
extensively
devel
oped
have
now
become
extinct
looking
still
more
remotely
to
the
future
we
may
predict
that
owing
to
the
continued
and
steady
increase
of
the
larger
groups
multitude
of
smaller
groups
will
become
utterly
extinct
and
leave
no
modified
descendants
and
consequently
that
of
the
species
living
at
any
one
period
extremel
few
will
transmit
descendants
to
remote
futurity
shall
have
to
return
to
this
subject
in
the
chapter
on
classification
but
may
add
that
on
this
view
of
ex
tremely
few
of
the
more
ancient
species
having
transmitted
descendants
and
on
the
view
of
all
the
descendants
of
the
same
species
making
class
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
there
exist
but
very
few
classes
in
each
main
division
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
although
extremely
few
of
the
most
ancient
species
may
now
have
living
and
modified
descendants
yet
at
the
most
remote
geological
period
the
earth
may
have
been
as
well
peopled
with
many
species
of
many
genera
families
orders
and
classes
as
at
the
present
day
distingunished
naturalist
has
objected
that
the
con
tinued
action
of
natural
selection
and
divergence
will
tend
to
make
an
indefinite
number
of
specific
forms
as
far
as
mere
inorganic
conditions
are
concerned
it
seems
proba
blo
that
sufficient
number
of
species
would
soon
become
cxar

divergence
of
oharaoter
116
adapted
to
all
considerable
diversities
of
heat
moisture
&c
but
fully
admit
that
the
mutual
relations
of
or
ganic
beings
are
the
most
important
and
as
the
number
of
species
in
any
country
goes
on
increasing
the
organic
conditions
of
life
will
become
more
and
more
complex
consequently
there
seems
at
first
to
be
no
limit
to
the
amount
of
profitable
diversification
of
structure
and
there
fore
no
limit
to
the
number
of
species
which
might
be
produced
we
do
not
know
that
even
the
most
prolific
area
is
fully
stocked
with
specific
forms
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
which
supports
such
an
astonishing
number
of
species
many
european
plants
have
become
naturalised
but
geology
shows
us
at
least
within
the
whole
immense
tertiary
period
that
the
number
of
species
of
shells
and
probably
of
mamimnals
has
not
increased
what
then
checks
an
indefinite
increase
in
the
number
of
species{
firstly
the
amount
of
life
i
do
not
mean
the
number
of
specific
forms
supported
on_any
area
must
have
limit
depending
80
largely
as
it
does
on
physical
conditions
therefore
where
very
many
species
are
supported
each
or
nearly
each
will
be
few
in
individuals
and
any
species
with
scanty
numbers
would
be
liable
to
extermination
from
accidental
fluctuations
in
the
nature
of
seasons
and
in
the
number
of
its
enemies
the
process
of
extermina
tion
would
in
such
cases
be
rapid
whereas
the
process
of
the
production
of
new
species
would
always
be
slow
im
agine
the
extreme
case
of
as
many
species
as
individuals
in
england
and
the
first
severe
winter
or
very
dry
sum
mer
would
exterminate
thousands
on
thousands
of
species
and
individuals
of
other
species
would
take
their
places
secondly
suspect
that
when
any
species
becomes
very
rare
close
interbreeding
will
tend
to
exterminate
it
at
least
anthors
have
thought
that
this
comes
into
klay
in
ac
counting
for
the
deterioration
of
aurochs
in
lithuania
of
red
deer
in
scotland
and
of
bears
in
norway
&c
thirdly
as
far
as
animals
are
concerned
some
species
are
closely
adapted
to
prey
on
some
one
other
being
but
if
this
other
being
had
been
rare
it
would
not
have
been
any
advantage
to
the
animal
to
have
been
produced
in
close
relation
to
its
prey
therefore
it
would
not
have
117%
natural
selection
omar
iv
been
produced
by
natural
selection
fourthly
when
any
species
becomes
few
in
number
the
process
of
modifica
tion
will
be
slower
for
the
chance
of
favourable
variations
arising
will
be
lessened
therefore
if
we
suppose
an
area
to
be
inhabited
by
very
many
species
each
or
nearly
each
species
will
be
poor
in
individuals
and
consequently
the
process
of
modification
and
of
giving
birth
to
new
forms
will
be
retarded
fifthly
and
this
am
inclined
to
think
is
the
most
important
element
dominant
species
which
has
already
beaten
many
competitors
in
its
own
home
will
tend
to
spread
and
supplant
many
others
alph
de
candolle
has
shown
that
those
species
which
spread
widely
tend
generally
to
spread
very
widely
and
consequently
they
will
tend
to
exterminate
several
species
in
several
areas
and
thus
check
the
inordinate
increase
of
st}l)eciﬂc
forms
throughout
the
world
hooker
has
re
cently
shown
that
in
the
8
e
corner
of
australia
where
apparently
there
are
many
invaders
from
different
quar
ters
of
the
world
the
endemic
australian
species
have
apparently
been
greatly
reduced
in
number
how
much
welght
to
attribute
to
these
several
causes
do
not
pre
tend
to
assign
but
conjointly
think
they
must
limit
in
each
country
the
tendency
to
an
indefinite
augmentation
of
specific
forms
atural
selection
acts
as
we
have
seen
exclusivel
by
the
preservation
and
accumulation
of
variations
whic
are
beneficial
under
the
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
of
life
to
which
each
creature
is
at
each
successive
period
exposed
the
ultimate
result
will
be
that
each
creature
will
tend
to
become
more
and
more
improved
in
relation
to
its
conditions
of
life
this
improvement
will
think
inevitably
lead
to
the
gradual
advancement
of
the
organi
sation
of
the
greater
number
of
living
beings
throughout
the
world
but
here
we
enter
on
very
intricate
sub
ject
for
naturalists
have
not
defined
to
each
other’s
satis
faction
what
is
meant
by
an
advance
in
organisation
amongst
the
vertebrata
the
degree
of
intellect
and
an
approach
in
structure
to
man
clearly
come
into
play
it
might
be
thought
that
the
amount
of
change
which
the
various
parts
and
organs
undergo
in
their
development
omar
iv
divergenoe
of
character
118%
from
the
embryo
to
maturity
would
suffice
as
standard
of
comparison
but
there
are
cases
as
with
certain
para
gitic
crustaceans
in
which
several
parts
of
the
structure
become
less
perfect
and
even
monstrous
so
that
the
ma
ture
animal
cannot
be
called
higher
than
its
larva
von
baer’s
standard
seems
the
most
widely
applicable
and
the
best
namely
the
amount
of
differentiation
of
the
differ
ent
parts
in
the
adult
state
as
should
be
inclined
to
add
and
their
specialisation
for
different
functions
or
as
milne
edwards
would
express
it
the
completeness
of
the
division
of
physiologicaf
labour
but
we
shall
see
how
obscure
subject
this
is
if
we
look
for
instance
to
fish
amongst
which
some
naturalists
rank
those
as
high
est
which
like
the
sharks
approach
nearest
to
reptiles
whilst
other
naturalists
rank
tge
common
bony
or
teleos
tean
fishes
as
the
highest
inasmuch
as
they
are
most
strictly
fish-like
and
differ
most
from
the
other
vertebrate
orders
still
more
plainly
we
see
the
obscurity
of
the
subject
by
turning
to
plants
where
the
standard
of
intel
lect
is
of
course
quite
excluded
and
here
some
botanists
rank
those
plants
as
highest
which
have
every
organ
as
sepals
petals
stamens
and
pistils
fully
developed
in
each
flower
whereas
other
botanists
probably
with
more
truth
look
at
the
plants
which
have
their
several
organs
much
modified
and
somewhat
reduced
in
number
as
being
of
the
highest
rank
if
we
look
at
the
differentiation
and
specialisation
of
the
several
organs
of
each
being
when
adult
and
this
will
include
the
advancement
of
the
brain
for
intellectual
purposes
as
the
best
standard
of
highness
of
organisa
tion
natural
selection
will
clearly
lead
towards
highness
for
all
physiologists
admit
that
the
specialisation
of
organs
inasmuch
as
they
perform
in
this
state
their
functions
bet
ter
is
an
advantage
to
each
being
and
hence
the
accu
mulation
of
variations
tending
towards
specialisation
is
within
the
scope
of
natural
selection
on
the
other
hand
we
can
see
bearing
in
mind
that
all
organic
beings
are
striving
to
increase
at
high
ratio
and
to
seize
on
every
ill-occupied
place
in
the
economy
of
nature
that
it
is
quite
possible
for
natural
selection
gradually
to
fit
an
or
119%
natural
selection
omar
iv
anic
being
to
situation
in
which
several
organs
wonld
ge
superfluous
and
useless
and
in
such
cases
there
might
be
retrogression
in
the
scale
of
organisation
whether
organisation
on
the
whole
has
actually
advanced
from
the
remotest
geological
periods
to
the
present
day
will
be
more
conveniently
discussed
in
our
cﬁapter
on
geological
succession
but
it
may
be
objected
that
if
all
organic
beings
thus
tend
to
rise
in
the
scale
how
is
it
that
throughout
the
world
multitude
of
the
lowest
forms
still
exist
and
how
is
it
that
in
each
great
class
some
forms
are
far
more
highly-developed
than
others
why
have
not
the
more
highly-developed
forms
everywhere
supplanted
and
exter
minated
the
lower
lamarck
who
believed
in
an
innate
and
inevitable
tendency
towards
perfection
in
all
organic
beings
seems
to
have
felt
this
difficulty
so
strongly
that
he
was
led
to
suppose
that
new
and
simple
forms
were
continually
being
erodnced
by
spontaneous
generation
need
hardly
say
that
science
in
her
progress
has
forbid
den
us
to
believe
that
living
creatures
are
now
ever
pro
duced
from
inorganic
matter
on
my
theory
the
present
existence
of
lowly
organized
productions
offers
no
diffi
culty
for
natural
selection
inclndes
no
necessary
and
universal
law
of
advancement
or
development
it
only
takes
advantage
of
such
variations
as
arise
and
are
bene
ficial
to
each
creature
under
its
complex
relations
of
life
and
it
may
be
asked
what
advantage
as
far
as
we
can
see
would
it
be
to
an
infusorian
animalcule—to
an
intes
tinal
worm—or
even
to
an
earth-worm
to
be
highly
or
anized
if
it
were
no
advantage
these
forms
would
be

by
natural
selection
unimproved
or
but
little
im
proved
and
might
remain
for
indefinite
ages
in
their
present
little
advanced
condition
arnd
geology
tells
us
that
some
of
the
lowest
forms
as
the
infusoria
and
rhizo
pods
have
remained
for
an
enormous
period
in
nearly
their
present
state
but
to
suppose
that
most
of
the
many
now-existing
low
forms
have
not
in
the
least
advanced
since
the
first
dawn
of
life
would
be
rash
for
every
naturalist
who
has
dissected
some
of
the
beings
now
ranked
as

low

often
have

nearly
the
eame
remarks
are
applicable
if
we
look
to
the
great
existing
differences
in
the
grades
of
organisation
within
almost
every
class
excepting
birds
for
instance
to
the
coexistence
of

to
the
coexistence
of

and
the

amongst

amongst

of
the

and
amphioxus
which
latter
fish
in
the
extreme
simplicity
of
its
structure
closely
approaches
the

the
advancement
of

would
not

believe
that

that

members
of
the

would
not
it
is
probable
tend
to
supplant
the
amphioxus
the
struggle
for
existence
in
the
case
of
the

must
lie
with

of

the

of

although

on

the

still

degrees
for
the

seem
to
have

from

where
they

where

can
only
say
that
we
have
no

us
and
therefore
that
all
speculations
on

would

during

of
ages
and
under

conditions

organic
leings
vary
at
all
in
the

already

how

and
how
largely

has
acted

history
geology

natural

for

can
be
supported
on
the

the
more
they
diverge
in
structure
habits
and
constitution
of
which
we
see
proof
by
looking
at
the
inhabitants
of
any
small
spot
or
at
naturalised
productions
therefore
during
the
modi
fication
of
the
descendants
of
any
one
species
and
during
the
incessant
struggle
of
all
species
to
increase
in
numbers
the
more
diversiﬁged
these
descendants
become
the
better
will
be
their
chance
of
succeeding
in
the
battle
of
life
thus
the
small
differences
distinguishing
varieties
of
the

species
will
steadily
tend
to
increase
till
they
come
to
equal
the
greater
differences
between

of
the

or
even
of

have
seen
that
it
is
the
common
the
widely-diffused
and
widely-ranging
species
belonging
to
the
larger
genera
which
vary
most
and
these
will
tend
to
transmit
to
their
modified
offspring
that
superiority
which
now
makes
them
dominant
in
their
own
countries
natural
selection
as
has
just
been
remarked
leads
to
divergence
of
character
and
to
much
extinetion
of
the
lessimproved

on
these
principles
believe
that
the

in

of
the

in
each

throughout
the
world
as.well
as
the
nature
of

may
be

all

seem
rather
to

so

on

can
see
no
explanation
of
this
great
fact
in

to
the
best
of
my
judgment
it
is
explained
through

the

this

is
wholly
in

but
it
serves
to
acknowledge
plainly
our
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
each
particular

some
authors
believe
it
to
be
as
much
the
function
of
the
reproductive
system
to
produce
individual
differences
or
very
slight
deviations
of

to

the
much
greater
variability
as
well
as
the
greater
frequency
of
monstrosities
under

mestication
or

than
under

leads
me
to
believe
that
deviations
of

are
in
some
way
due
to
the
nature
of
the
conditions
of

which
the

be
necessary
to
show
the
truth
of
the
remark
that
the
reproductive
system
is
eminently
susceptible
to
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
and
to
this
system
being
functionally

however

how

my
impression
is
that
the
effect
is
extremely
small
in
the
case
of
animals
but
perhaps
rather
more
in
that
of
plants
we
may
at
least
safely
conclude
that
such
influences
can
not
have
produced
the
many
striking
and
complex
co
adaptations
of

organic
being
and
another
which
we
see
everywhere
throughout

some
little

may
be

thus
e

confidently
that

he
who

have
to
say
that

that
this

we
cannot

of
it
to
attribute
to
the

how

to

thus
it

how

that

has
remarked
there
is
no
greater
anomaly
in

than
bird
that
cannot

are

the

of

as
the

as
the
larger
ground-feeding
birds
seldom
take

except
to
escape

believe
that
the
nearly
wingless
condition
of
several
birds
which
now
in
habit
or
have
lately
inhabited
several
oceanic
islands
tenanted
by
no
beast
of

has
been
caused
by
disuse
the
ostrich
indeed
inhabits
continents
and
is
exposed
to
danger
from
which
it
cannot
escape
by
flight
but
by
kkicking
it
can
defend
itself
from
enemies
as
well
as
any
of
the
smaller
quadrupeds
we
may
imagine
that
the
early
progenitor
of
the
ostrich
had
habits
like
those
of
bustard
and
that
as
natural
selection
increased
in
succes
sive
generations
the
size
and
weight
of
its
body
its
legs
were
used
more
and
its
wings
less
until
they
became
in
capable
of
flight
kirby
has
remarked
and
have
observed
the
same
fact
that
the
anterior
tarsi
or
feet
of
many
male
dung
feeding
beetles
are
very
often
broken
off
he
examined
seventeen
specimens
in
his
own
collection
and
not
one
had
even
relic
left
in
the
onites
apelles
the
tarsi
are
so
habitually
lost
that
the
insect
has
been
described
as
not
having
them
in
some
other
genera
they
are
present
but
in
a_rudimentary
condition
the
ateuchus
or
sacred
beetle
of
the
egyptians
they
are
totally
deficient
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
to
induce
ns
to
believe
that
mu
tilations
are
ever
inherited
and
should
prefer
explain
ing
the
entire
absence
of
the
anterior
tarsi
in
ateuchus
and
their
rudimentary
condition
in
some
other
genera
by
the
long-continued
effects
of
disuse
in
their
progenitors
for
as
the
tarsi
are
almost
always
lost
in
many
dung-feed
ing
bestles
they
must
be
lost
early
in
life
and
therefore
cannot
be
much
used
by

that
200
beetles
out
of
the

species
inhabiting

are
so
far
deficient
in

that
they
cannot

have
all
their

in

sev
facts
namely
that
beetles
in
many
parts
of
the
world
are
very
frequently
blown
to

and
g;arish
that
the
beetles
in
madeira
as
observed
by
mr
wollaston
lie
much
concealed
until
the
wind
lulls
and
the

shines
that
the

of

less
beetles
is
larger

the
extraordinary
fact
so
strongly
insisted
on
by
mr

of
the

of

elsewhere
ex

and
which

have

of

almost
necessitating

these
several
con
siderations
have
made
me
believe
that
the
wingless
con
dition
of
so
many
madeira
beetles
is
mainly
due
to
the
action
of
natural
selection
but
combined
probably
with
disuse
for
during
thousands
of
successive
generations
each
individual
beetle
which
flew
least
either
from
its

having
been
ever
so

perfectly

or
from

will
have
had
the
best
chance
of
surviving
from
not
being
blown

and
on
the

hand
those
beetles
which
most
readily
took

will
oftenest
have
been
blown

and
thus
have
been

might
in

be

and
if
so

would
constantly
aid
the

it
is
well
known
that
several

belonging

inhabit

attribute
their

wholly
to

in

of.the

the

are
of

thought
that

so
in
the
case
of
the

natural
selection
seems
to
have
stru%gled
with
the

and
to
have
increased

of

that
on

of

having
been

created
for

close

in

might
have
been
expected
but
as
schicdte
and
others
have
remarked
this
is
not
the
case
and
the
cave-insects
of
the

are
not
more
closely
allied
than
might
hawe
been
anticipated
from
the
general
resemblance
of
the
other

of

on
my
view
we
must
suppose
that:amer

slowly
migrated
by
successive
generations
from

into

we
have
some
evidence
of
this

as

we
accordingly
look
upon
the
subter

faunas
as

which
have
penetra

into

the
geographically-limited

tinent
and
in

to
the

and
this
is
the
case
with
some
of
the
american

hear
from

some
of
the

are
verly

of

it
would
be
most
difficult
to
give
any
rational
explanation
of
the

of
the

we
might
expect
from

some

species
of

as

with

with

am
only
surprised
that
more
wrecks
of
ancient
life
have
not
been
preserved
owing
to
the
less
severe
competition
to
which
the

probably

acclimatisation—habit

in

&c
and
this
leads
me
to
say
few
words
on
acclimatisation
as
it
is
extremely
common
for
species
of
the
same
genus
to
in
habit
very
hot
and
very
cold
countries
and
as
believe
that
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
have
descended
from
single
parent
if
this
view
be
correct
acclimatisa
tion
must
be
readily
effected
during
long-continued
descent
it
is
notorious
that
each
species
is
adapted
to
the
climate
of
its
own
home
species
from
an
arctic
or
even
from
temperate
region
cannot
endure
tropical
climate
or
conversely
so
again
many
succulent
plants
cannot
endure
damp
climate
but
the
degree
of
adap
tation
of
species
to
the
climates
under
whicgr
they
live
is
often
overrated
we
may
infer
this
from
our
frequent
in
ability
to
predict
whether
or
not
an
imported
{
ant
will
endure
our
climate
and
from
the
number
of
plants
and
animals
brought
from
warmer
countries
which
here
enjoy
good
health
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
species
in
state
of
nature
are
limited
in
their
ranges
by
the
compe
tition
of
other
organic
beings
quite
as
much
as
or
more
than
by
adaptation
to
particular
climates
but
whether
1928
laws
of
variation
onar
v
or
not
the
adaptation
be
generally
very
close
we
have
evidence
in
the
case
of
some
few
plants
of
their
becom
ing
to
certain
extent
naturally
habituated
to
different
temperatures
or
becoming
acclimatised
thus
the
pines
and
rhododendrons
raised
from
seed
collected
by
dr
hooker
from
trees
growing
at

heights

largely
extended
their
range
from

to

tudes
and
conversely
but
we
do
not
positively
know
that
these
animals
were
strictly
adapted
to
their
native
climate
but
in
all
ordinary
cases
we
assume
such
to
be
the
case
nor
do
we
know
that
they
have
subsequently
become
acclimatised
to
their
new
homes
as
believe
that
our
domestic
animals
were
originally
chosen
by
uncivilised
man
because
they
were
useful
and
bred
readily
under
confinement
and
not
because
they
were
subsequently
found
capable
of
far-extended
trans
portation
think
the
common
and
extraordinary
capacity
in
our
domestic
animals
of
not
only
withstanding
the
most
different
climates
but
of
being
perfectly
fertile
%a
far
severer
test
under
them
may
be
used
as
an
argument
that
large
proportion
of
other
animals
now
in

nature
could
easily
be
brought
to
bear
widely
different
climates
we
must
not
however
push
the
foregoing
ar
gument
too
far
on
account
of
the
probable
origin
of
some
of
our
domestic
animals
from
several
wild
stocks
the
blood
for
instance
of
tropical
and
arctic
wolf
or
wild
dog
may
perhaps
be
mingled
in
our
domestic
breeds
the
rat
and
mouse
cannot
be
considered
as
domestic
animals
but
they
have
been
transported
by
man
to
many
parts
of
the
world
and
now
have
far
wider
range
than
any
other
rodent
living
free
under
the
cold
climate
of
faroe
in
the
north
and
of
the
falklands
in
the
south

on

the

hdw
much
of
the

is
due

and
how
much
to
the
natural
selection
of
varieties
having
different
innate
constitutions
and
how
much
to
both
means
combined
is
very
obscure
question
that
habit
or
custom
has
some
influence
must
believe
both
from
analogy
and
from
the
incessant
advice
given
in
agricultural
works
even
in
the
ancient
encyclopsedias
of
china
to
be
very
cautious
in
transposing
animals
from
one
district
to
another
for
it
is
not
likely
that
man
should
have
succeeded
in
selecting
80
many
breeds
and
sub-breeds
with
constitutions
spe
cially
fitted
for
their
own
districts
the
result
must
ink
be
due
to
habit
on
the
other
hand
can
see
no
reason
to
doubt
that
natural
selection
will
continuall
tend
to
preserve
those
individuals
which
are
born
wi
constitutions
best
adapted
to
their
native
countries
in
treatises
on
many
kinds
of
cultivated
plants
certain
vari
eties
are
said
to
withstand
certain
climates
better
than
others
this
is
very
strikingly
shown
in
works
on
fruit
trées
published
in
the
united
states
in
which
certain
varieties
are
habitdally
recommended
for
the
northern
and
others
for
the
southern
states
and
as
most
of
these
varieties
are
of
recent
origin
they
cannot
owe
their
con
stitutional
differences
to
habit
case
of
the
jerusalem
artichoke
which
is
never
propagated
by

and
of
which

even
been
advanced—for
it
is
now
as
tender
as
ever

proving
that

cannot
be
effected
the
case
also
of
the

has
been
often
cited
for
similar
purpose
and
with

with

the

cannot

to
have
been

be

that

account
has
been

how
much
more
hardy
some

on
the
whole
think
we
may
conclude
that
habit
use

disuse
have
in
some
cases
played
considerable
part
in
the
modification
of
the
constitution
and
of
the
structure
of
various
organs
but
that
the
effects
of
use
and
disuse
have
often
been
largely
combined
with
and
sometimes
overmastered
by
the
natural
selection
of
innate
differences
correlation
of
growth—i
mean
by
this
expression
that
the
whole
organisation
is
so
tied
together
during
its
growth
and
development
that
when
slight
variations
in
any
one
part
occur
and
are
accumulated
through
natural
selection
other
parts
become
modified
this
is
very
important
subject
most
imperfectly
understood
the
most
obvious
case
is
that
modifications
accumulated
solely
for
the
good
of
the
young
or
larva
will
it
may
safely
be
concluded
affect
the
structure
of
the
adult
in
the
same
manner
as
any
malconformation
affecting
the
early
embryo
seriously
affects
the
whole
organisation
of
the
adult
the
sevem{
parts
of
the
body
which
are
homo
logous
and
which
at
an
early
embryonic
period
are
alike
seem
liable
to
vary
in
an
allied
manner
we
see
this
in
the
right
and
left
sides
of
the
body
varying
in
the

manner
in
the
front
and
hind
legs
and
even
in
the

and
limbs
varying
together
for
the
lower

is
believed
to
be
homologous
with
the
limbs
these
ten
dencies
do
not
doubt
may
be
mastered
more
or
less
completely
by
natural
selection
thus

once
existed
with
an
antler
only
on

side
and
if

these

be

we
know
at

that
in

flowers
those
nearest

are

subject
to

and
become

may
add
as
an
instance
of
this
and
of
strik
ing
case
of
correlation
that
have
recently
observed
in
some
garden
pelargoniums
that
the
central
flower
of
the
truss
often
loses
the
patches
of
darker
colour
in
the
two
upper
petals
and
that
when
this
occurs
the
adherent
nectary
is
quite
aborted
when
the
colour
is
absent
from
only
one
of
the
two
upper
petals
the
nectary
is
only
much
shortened
with
respect
to
the
difference
in
the
corolla
of
the
central
and
exterior
flowers
of
head
or
umbel
do
not
feel
at
all
sure
that
c
c
sprengel’s
idea
that
the
ray
florets
serve
to
attract
insects
whose
agency
is
highly
ad
vantageous
in
the
fertilisation
of
plants
of
these
two
orders
is
so
far-fetched
as
it
may
at
first
appear
and
if
it
be
advantageous
natural
selection
may
have
come
into
play
butinregard
to
the
differences
bothin
the
internal
and
external
structure
of
the
seeds
which
are
not
always
correlated
with
any
differcucesin
the
flowers
it
seems
im
possible
that
they
can
be
in
any
way
advantagcous
to
the
plant
yet
in
the
umbelliferse
these
differences
are
of
such
apparent
importance—the
seeds
being
in
some
cases
ac
cording
to
tausch
orthospermous
in
the
exterior
flowers
and
ceelospermous
in
the

the
elder
de
candolle
founded
his
main
divisions
of
the
order
on
omar
v
correlation
of

133
analogous
differences
hence
wo
see
that
meodifications
of
structure
viewed
by
systematists
as
of
high
vaiue
may
be
wholly
due
to
unknown
laws
of
correlaf
owth
and
without
being
as
far
as
we
can
see
of
the
slightest
service
to
the
species
we
may
often
falsely
attribute
to
correlation
of
growth
structures
which
are
common
to
whole
groups
of
species
and
which
in
truth
are
simply
due
to
inﬁzritance
for
an
ancient
progenitor
may
have
acquired
through
natural
selection
some
one
modification
in
structure
and
after
thousands
of
generations
some
other
and
independent
modification
and
these
two
modifications
having
been
transmitted
to
whole
group
of
descendants
with
diverse
habits
would
naturally
be
thought
to
be
correlated
in
some
necessary
manner
so
again
do
not
doubt
that
some
apparent
correlations
occurring
throughout
whole
orders
are
entirely
due
to
the
manner
alone
in
which
nat
ural
selection
can
act
for

alph
de
candolle
has
remarked
that
winged
seeds
are
never
found
in
fruits
which
do
not
open
should
explain
the
rule
by
the
fact
that
seeds
cou})d
not
gradually
become
winged
through
natural
selection
except
in
fruits
which
opened
so
that
the
individual
plants
producing
seeds
which
were
little
better
fitted
to
%e
wafted
further
might
get
an
advantage
over
those
producing

fitted

think
this

also

of

for
it
will
profit
the
in
dividual
not
to
have
its
nutriment
wasted
in
building
up
an
useless
structure
can
thus
only
understand
fact
with
which
was
much
struck
when
examining
cirripedes
and
of
which
many
other
instances
could
be
given
namely
that
when
cirripede
is
parasitic
within
another
and
is
thus
protected
it
loses
more
or
less
completely
its
own
shell
or
carapace
this
is
the
case
with
the
male
ibla
and
in
truly
extraordinary
manner
with
the
pro
teolepas
for
the
carripace

all
other
cirripedes
consist
of
the
three
highly-important
anterior
segments
of
the
head
enormously
develoved
and
furnished
with
great
nerves
and
muscles
but
in
the
parasitic
and
protected
proteolepas
the
whole
anterior
part
of
the
head
is
reduced
to
the
merest
rudiment
attached
to

bases

thus
a8
believe
natural

will
always
succeed
in
the
long
run
in
reducing
and
saving
every
part
of
the
organisation
as
soon
as
it
1s
rendered
superfluous
without
by
any

causing

it
seems
to

as
remarked
by

geoffroy
st

both
in

and
in
species
that
when
any
part
or

is
re{mated
many
times
in
the
structure
of
the
same
individual
as
the
vertebrs
in
snakes
and
the
stamens
in
polyandrous
flowers
the
number
is
variable
whereas
the
number
of
the
same
part
or
organ
when
it
occurs
in
lesser
numbers
is
constant
the
same
author
and
some
botanists
have
further
remarked
that
multiple
parts
are
also
very
liable
to
variation
in
structure
inas
much
as
this
vegetative
repetition
to
use
prof
owen’s
expression
seems
to
be
sign
of
low
organisation
the
foregoing
remark
seems
connected
with
the
very
general
opinion
of
naturalists
that
beings
low
in
the
scale
of
nature
are
more
variable
than
those
which
are
higher
presume
that
lowness
in
this
case
means
that
the
several
arts
of
the
organisation
have
been
but
little
specialised
or
particular
functions
and
as
long
as
the
same
part
has
to
perform
diversified
work
we
can
perhaps
see
why
it
should
remain
variable
that
is
why
natural
selection
should
have
preserved
or
rejected
each
little
deviation
of
form
less
carefully
than
when
the
part
has
to
serve
for
one
sﬁaeeial
purpose
alone
in
the
same
way
that
knife
which
has
to
cut
all
sorts
of
things
may
be
of
almost
any
shape
whilst

for
some
particular
object
had
better
be

}:)natural

should
never
be

of

througi
and
for
its
advantage
udimentary
parts
it
has
been
stated
by
some
authors
and
believe
with
truth
are
apt
to
be
highly

we
shall
have
to
recur
to
the
general
subject
of
rudimen
tary
and

organs
and
will
here
only
add
that
136
laws
of

cmar
v
their
variability
seems
to
be
owing
to
their
uselessness
and
therefore
to
natural
selection
having
no
power
to
check
deviations
in
their
structure
thus
rudimentary
parts
are
left
to
the
free
play
of
the
various
laws

the
effects

with

to

years
ago
was
much
struck
with
remark
nearly
to
the
above
effect
published
by
mr
waterhouse
infer
also
from
an
observation
made
by
professor
owen
with
respect
to
the
length
of
the
arms
of
the
ourang-outang
that
he
has
come
to
nearly
similar
conclusion
it
is
hopeless
to
attempt
to
convince
any
one
of
the
truth
of
this
proposi
tion
without
giving
the
long
array
of
facts
which
eave
collected
and
which
cannot
possibly
be
here
introduced
can
only
state
my
conviction
that
it
is
rule
of
high
ﬁenemlity
am
aware
of
several
causes
of
error
but
ope
that
have
made
due
allowance
for
them
it
should
be
understood
that
the
rule
by
no
means
applies
to
any
gart
however
unusually
developed
unless
it
it))e
unusually
eveloped
in
comparison
with
the
same
part
in
closely
allied
species
thus
the
bat’s
wing
is
most
abnormal
structure
in
the
class
mammalia
but
the
rule
would
not
here
apply
because
there
is
whole
group
of
bats
having
wings
it
would
apply
only
if
some
one
species
of
bat
had
its
wings
developed
in
some
remarkable
man
ner
in
comparison
with
the
other
species
of
the
same
genus
the
rule
applies
very
strongly
in
the
case
of
secondary
sexual
characters
when
displayed
in
any
un
usual
manner
the
term
secondary
scxual
characters
used
by
hunter
applies
to
characters
which
are
attached
to
one
sex
but
are
not
directly
connected
with
the
act
of
reproduction
the
rule
applies-to
males
and
females
but
as
females
more
rarefy
offer
remarkable
secondary
sexnal
characters
it
applies
more
rarely
to
them
the
rule
being
so
plainly
applicable
in
the
case
of
secondary
sexual
characters
may
be
due
to
the
great
variability
of
omar
v
laws
of
variation
1387
these
characters
whether
or
not
displayed
in
any
unusual
manner—of
which
fact
think
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
that
our
rule
is
not
confined
to
secondary
sexual
char
acters
is
clearly
shown
in
the
case
of
herma})hrodite
cirri
pedes
and
may
here
add
that
particularly
attended
to
mr
waterhouse’s
remark
whilst
investigating
this
order
and
am
fully
convinced
that
the
rule
almost
invariably
holds
good
with
cirripedes
shall,in
future
work
give
list
of
the
more
remarkable
cases
will
here
only
briefly
give
one
as
it
illustrates
the
rule
in
its
largest
application
the
opercular
valves
of
sessile
cirripedes
rock
barnacles
are
in
every
sense
of
the
word
very
important
structures
and
they
differ
extreme
ly
little
even
in
different
genera
but
in
the
several
spe
cies
of
one
genus
pyrgoma
these
valves
present
mar
vellous
amount
of
diversification
the
homologous
valves
in
the
different
species
being
sometimes
wholly
unlike
in
shape
and
the
amount
of
variation
in
the
individuals
of
several
of
the
species
is
so
great
that
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
state
that
tﬁe
varieties
differ
more
from
each
other
in
the
characters
of
these
important
valves
than
do
other
species
of
distinct
genera
as
birds
within
the
same
country
vary
in
remark
ably
small
degree
have
particularly
attended
to
them
a.mf
the
rule
seems
to
me
certainly
to
hold
good
in
this
class
cannot
make
out
that
it
applies
to
plants
and
this
would
seriously
have
shaken
my%elief
in
its
truth
had
not
the
great
variability
in
plants
made
it
particularly
difficult
to
compare
their
relative
degrees
of
variability
when
we
see
any
part
or
organ
developed
in
re
markable
degree
or
manner
in
any
species
the
fair
pre
sumption
is
that
it
is
of
high
importance
to
that
species
nevertheless
the
part
in
this
case
is
eminently
liable
tc
variation
why
should
this
be
s0
on
the
view
that
each
species
has
been
independently
created
with
all
its
parts
as
we
now
see
them
can
see
no
explanation
but
on
the
view
that
groups
of
species
have
descended
from
other
species
angr
have
been
modified
through
natural
selection
think
we
can
obtain
some
light
our
do
mestic
animals
if
any
part
or
the
whole
animal
be
neg
188
laws
of
variation
cumar
¥
lected
and
no
selection
be
applied
that
part
for
instance
the
comb
in
the
dorking
fowl
or
the
whole
breed
wi
cease
to
have
nearly
uniform
character
the
breed
will
then
be
said
to
have
degenerated
in
rudimentary
or
ans
and
in
those
which
have
been
but
little
specialised
or
any
particular
purpose
and
perhaps
in
polymorphic
groups
we
see
nearly
parallel
natural
case
for
in
such
cases
natural
selection
either
has
not
or
cannot
come
into
full
play
and
thus
the
organisation
is
left
in
fluctuating
condition
but
what
here
more
especially
concerns
us
is
that
in
our
domestic
animals
those
points
which
at
the
present
time
are
undergoing
rapid
change
by
continued
selection
are
also
eminently
liable
to
variation
look
at
the
breeds
of
the
pigeon
see
what
prodigious
amount
of
difference
there
is
in
the
beak
of
the
different
tumblers
in
the
beak
and
wattle
of
the
different
carriers
in
the
carriage
and
tail
of
our
fantails
&c
these
being
the
ints
now
mainly
attended
to
by
english
fanciers
even
1n
the
sub-breeds
as
in
the
short-faced
tumbler
it
is
no
toriously
difficult
to
breed
them
nearly
to
perfection
and
frequently
individuals
are
born
which
depart
widely
from
the
standard
there
may
be
truly
said
to
be
constant
struggle
going
on
between
on
the
one
hand
the
tendency
to
reversion
to
less
modified
state
as
well
as
an
innate
tendency
to
further
variability
of
all
kinds
and
on
the
other
hand
the
power
of
steady
selection
to
keep
the
breed
true
in
ﬂge
long
run
selection
gains
the
day
and
we
do
not
expect
to
fail
so
far
as
to
breed
bird
as
coarse
as
common
tumbler
from
good
short-faced
strain
but
as
long
as
selection
is
rapidly
going
on
there
may
always
be
expected
to
be
much
variability
in
the
structure
under
going
modification
it
further
deserves
notice
that
these
variable
characters
produced
by
man’s
selection
some
times
become
attached
from
causes
quite
unknown
to
us
more
to
one
sex
than
to
the
other
generally
to
the
male
sex
as
with
the
wattle
of
carriers
and
the
enlarged
crop
of
pouters
now
let
us
turn
to
nature
when
part
has
been
de
veloped
in
an
extraordinary
manner
in
any
one
species
compared
with
the
other
species
of
the
same
genus
we
our
v
laws
of
variation
189
may
conclude
that
this
part
has
andergone
an
extraordi
nary
amount
of
modification
since
the
period
when
the
species
branched
off
from
the
common
progenitor
of
the
enus
this
period
will
seldom
be
remote
in
any
extreme
egree
as
species
very
rarely
endure
for
more
than
one
geological
period
an
extraordinary
amount
of
modifica
tion
implies
an
unusually
large
and
long-continued
amount
of
variability
which
has
continually
been
accumulated
by
natural
selection
for
the
benefit
of
the
species
but
as
the
variability
of
the
extraordinarily-developed
part
or
organ
has
been
so
frenf
and
long-continued
within
period
not
excessively
remote
we
miﬁht
a8
general
rule
expect
still
to
find
more
variability
in
such
parts
than
in
other
parts
of
the
organisation
which
have
re
mained
for
much
longer
period
nearly
constant
and
this
am
convinced
is
the
case
that
the
struggle
be
tween
natural
selection
on
the
one
hand
and
the
tendency
to
reversion
and
variability
on
the
other
hand
will
in
the
course
of
time
cease
and
that
the
most
abnormally
de
veloped
organs
may
be
made
constant
can
see
no
reason
to
doubt
hence
when
an
organ
however
abnormal
it
may
be
has
been
transmitted
in
a%proximately
the
same
condition
to
many
modified
descendants
as
in
the
case
of
the
wing
of
the
bat
it
must
have
existed
according
to
my
theory
for
an
immense
period
in
nearly
the
same
state
and
thus
it
comes
to
be
no
more
variable
than
any
other
structure
it
is
only
in
those
cases
in
which
the
modifi
cation
has
been
compa.rativeg
recent
and
extraordinarily
eat
that
we
ought
to
find
the
generative
variability
as
1t
may
be
called
still
present
in
high
degree
for
in
this
case
the
variability
will
seldom
as
yet
have
been
fixed
by
the
continued
selection
of
the
individuals
varying
in
the
required
manner
and
degree
and
by
the
continued
rejection
of
those
tending
to
revert
to
former
and
less
modified
condition
the
prineciple
included
in
these
remarks
may
be
ex
tended
it
is
notorious
that
specific
characters
are
more
variable
than
generic
to
explain
by
simple
example
what
is
meant
if
some
species
in
large
genus
of
plants
had
blue
flowers
and
some
had
red
the
colour
would
be
t
140
laws
of
variation
cmr
v
only
specific
character
and
no
one
would
be
surprised
at
one
of
the
blue
species
varying
into
red
or
conversely
but
if
all
the
species
had
blue
flowers
the
colour
would
become
generic
character
and
its
variation
would
be
more
unusual
circumstance
have
chosen
this
example
because
an
explanation
is
not
in
this
case
ap];licable
which
most
naturalists
would
advance
namely
that
spe
cific
characters
are
more
variable
than
generic
because
they
are
taken
from
parts
of
less
physiological
importance
than
those
commonly
used
for
classing
genera
believe
this
explanation
is
partly
yet
only
indirectly
true
shall
however
have
to
return
to®this
subject
in
our
chap
ter
on
classification
it
would
be
almost
superfluous
to
adduce
evidence
in
support
of
the
above
statement
that
specific
characters
are
more
variable
than
generic
bat
have
repeatedly
noticed
in
works
on
natural
history
that
when
an
author
has
remarked
with
suri)rise
that
some
tmportant
organ
or
part
which
is
generally
very
constant
throughout
large
groups
of
species
has
differed
consider
ably
in
closely-allied
species
that
it
has
also
been
vars
able
in
the
individuals
of
some
of
the
species
and
this
fact
shows
that
character
which
is
generally
of
generic
value
when
it
sinks
in
value
and
becomes
only
of
specific
value
often
becomes
variable
though
its
pﬂysio
ogical
importance
may
remain
the
same
something
of
the
same
kind
applies
to
monstrosities
at
least
is
geoffroy
st
hilaire
seems
to
entertain
no
doubt
that
the
more
an
organ
normally
differs
in
the
different
species
of
the.same
grmg
the
more
subject
it
is
to
individual
anomalies
the
ordinary
view
of
each
species
having
been
in
dependently
created
why
should
tﬁat
part
of
the
strue
ture
which
differs
from
the
same
part
in
other
independ
ently-created
species
of
the
same
genus
be
more
variable
than
those
parts
which
are
closely
alike
in
the
several
species
go
not
see
that
any
explanation
can
be
given
ut
on
the
view
of
species
being
only
strongly
marked
and
fixed
varieties
we
might
surely
expect
to
find
them
still
often
continving
to
vary
in
those
parts
of
their
struc
ture
which
have
varied
within
moderately
recent
period
and
which
have
thus
come
to

to

in
another
manner
the
points
in
which
all
tne
species
of
genus
resemble
each
other
and
in
which
they
differ
from
the
species
of
some
other
genus
are
called
generic
characters
and
these
characters
in
common
attributo
to
inheritance
from
common
progenitor
for
it
can
rarely
have
happened
that
natural
selection
will
have
modified
several
species
fitted
to
more
or
less
widely-different
habits
in
exactly
the
same
manner
and
as
these
so-called
generic
characters
have
been
inherited
from
remote
period
since
that
period
when
the
species
first
branched
off
from
their
common
progenitor
and
subsequently
have
not
varied
or
come
to
giﬁ'er
in
any
degree
or
only
in
slight
degree
it
is
not
ﬁmbable
that
they
should
va
at
the
present
day
on
the
other
hand
the
points
in
which
species
differ
from
other
species
of
the
same
genus
are
called
specific
characters
and
as
these
specific
characters
have
varied
and
come
to
differ
within
the
period
of
the
branchin%
off
of
the
species
from
common
progenitor
it
is
probable
that
they
should
still
often
be
in
some
degree
variable,—at
least
more
variable
than
those
parts
of
the
organisation
which
have
for
very
long
period
remained
constant
in
connexion
with
the
present
subject
will
make
only
two
other
remarks
think
it
will
be
admitted
without
my
entering
on
details
that
secondary
sexual
characters
are
very
variable
think
it
also
will
be
ad
mitted
that
species
of
the
same
group
differ
from
each
other
more
widely
in
their
secondary
sexual
characters
than
in
other
parts
of
their
organisation
compare
for
instance
the
amount
of
difference
between
the
males
of
gallinaceous
birds
in
which
secondary
sexual
characters
are
strongly
displayed
with
the
amount
of
difference
be
tween
their
females
and
the
truth
of
this
proposition
will
be
granted
the
cause
of
the
original
variability
of
secondary
sexual
characters
is
not
manifest
but
we
can
see
why
these
characters
should
not
haye
been
rendered
as
constant
and
uniform
as
other
parts
of
the
organisation
for
secondary
sexual
characters
have
been
accumulated
by
sexual
selection
wbich
is
less
rigid
in
its
action
than
ordinary
selection
as
it
does
not
entail
death
but
only
149

{omar

to
the
less
favoured

what
ever
the
cause
may
be
of
the
variability
of
secondary
sex
ual
characters
as
they
are
highly
variable
sexual
selection
will
have
had
wide
scope
z)r
action
and
may
thus
readily
have
succeeded
in
giving
to
the
species
of
the
same
group
greater
amount
of
difference
in
their
sexual
characters
than
in
other
parts
of
their
structure
it
is
remarkable
fact
that
the
secondary
sexual
dif
ferences
between
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
species
are
generally
displayed
in
the
very
same
parts
of
the
organi
sation
in
which
the
different
species
of
the
same
genus
differ
from
each
other
of
this
fact
will
give
in
illus
tration
two
instances
the
first
which
happen
to
stand
on
my
list
and
as
the
differences
in
these
cases
are
of
ver
unusual
nature
the
relation
can
hardly
be
accidental
the
same
number
of
joints
in
the
tarsi
is
character
gen
erally
common
to
very
large
groups
of
beetles
but
in
the
engide
as
westwood
has
remarked
the
number
varies
greatly
and
the
number
likewise
differs
in
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
species
again
in
fossorial
hymenoptera
the
manner
of
neuration
of
the
wings
is
character
of
the
highest
importance
because
common
to
large
%-ou
but
in
certain
genera
the
neuration
differs
in
the
different
species
and
likewise
in
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
species
is
relation
has
clear
meaning
on
my
view
of
the
sub
jeet
ilook
at
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
as
having
as
certainly
descended
from
the
same
progenitor
as
have
the
two
sexes
of
any
one
of
the
species
consequently
whatever
part
of
the
structure
of
the
common
progenitor
or
of
its
early
descendants
became
variable
variations
of
this
ﬁart
would
it
is
highly
probable
be
taken
advan
tage
of
by
natural
and
sexual
selection
in
order
to
fit
the
several
species
to
their
several
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
and
likewise
to
fit
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
spe
cies
to
each
other
or
to
fit
the
males
and
females
to
dif
ferent
habits
of
life
or
the
males
to
struggle
with
other
males
for
the
possession
of
the
females
finally
then
conclude
that
the
greater
variability
of
specific
characters
or
those
which
distinguish
species
from
species
than
of
generic
characters
or
those
which
the
omar

143
ies
possess
in
common
that
the

of
any

which
is

species
in
an
extraordinary
manner
in
comparison
with
the

ga.rt
in
its
congeners
and
the
not
great
degree
of
varia
ility
in
part
however
extraordinarily
it
may
be
devel
il
if
it
be
common
to
whole
group
of
species
that
great
variability
of
secondary
sexual
characters
and
the
amount
of
difference
in
these
same
characters
between
closely
allied
species
that
secondary
sexual
and
ordinarily
specific
differences
are
generally
displayed
in
the
same
parts
of
the
organisation,—are
all
principles
closely
connected
together
all
being
mainly
due
to
the
species
of
the
same
group
having
descended
from
com
mon
progenitor
from
whom
they
have
inherited
much
in
common
to
parts
which
have
recently
and
largely
varied
being
more
likely
still
to
go
on
varying
than
parts
which
have
long
been
inherited
and
have
not
varied,—to
natural
selection
having
more
or
less
completely
accord
ing
to
the
lapse
of
time
overmastered
the
tendency
to
re
version
and
to
further
variability,—to
sexual
selection
being
less
rigid
than
ordinary
selection,—and
to
variations
in
the
same
parts
having
been
accumulated
by
natural
and
sexual
selection
and
thus
adapted
for
secondary
sexual
and
for
ordinary
specific
purposes
distinct
species
present
analogous
variations
and
variety
of
one
species
often
assumes
some
of
the
characters
of
an
allied
spéciss
or
reverts
to
some
of
the
characters
of
an
early
progenitor.—these
propositions
will
be
most
readily
understood
by
looking
to
our
domestic
races
the
most
distinct
breeds
of
pigeons
in
countries
most
widely
apart
present
sub-varieties
with
reversed
feathers
on
the
head
and
feathers
on
the
feet,—characters
not
pos
sessed
by
the
aboriginal
rock-pigeon
these
then
are
an
alogous
variations
in
two
or
more
distinct
races
the
fre
ftglent
presence
of
fourteen
or
even
sixteen
tailfeathers
in
pouter
may
be
considered
as
variation
representing
the
normal
structure
of
another
race
the
fantail
pre
sume
that
no
one
will
doubt
that
all
such
analogous
varia

are
due
to
the
several
races
of
the
pigeon
having
144
laws
of
variation
cmar
v
inherited
from
common
parent
the
same
constitution
and
tendency
to
variation
when
acted
on
by
similar
unknown
influences
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
we
have
case
of
analogous
variation
in
the
enlarged
stems
or
roots
as
com
monly
called
of
the
swedish
turnip
and
ruta
baga
plants
which
several
botanists
rank
as
varieties
produced
by
cul
tivation
from
common
parent
if
this
be
not
so
the
case
will
then
be
one
of
analogous
variation
in
two
so-called
distinet
species
and
to
these
third
may
be
added
namely
the
commn
turnip
according
to
the
ordina;{
view
of
each
species
having
been
independently
created
we
should
have
to
attribute
this
similarity
in
the
enlarged
stems
of
these
three
plants
not
to
the
vera
causa
of
com
munity
of
descent
and
consequent
tendency
to
vary
in
like
manner
but
to
three
separate
yet
closely
related
acts
of
creation
with
pigeons
however
we
have
another
case
namely
the
occasional
appearance
in
all
the
breeds
of
slaty-blue
birds
with
two
black
bars
on
the
wings
white
rump
bar
at
the
end
of
the
tail
with
the
other
feathers
external
ly
edged
near
their
bases
with
white
as
all
these
re
marks
are
characteristic
of
the
parent
rock-pigeon
pre
sume
that
no
one
will
doubt
that
this
is
case
of
rever
sion
and
not
of
new
yet
analogous
variation
appearing
in
the
several
breeds
may
think
confidently
come
to
this
conclusion
because
as
we
have
seen
these
coloured
marks
are
eminently
liable
to
appear
in
the
crossed
offspring
of
two
distinct
and
differently
coloured
breeds
and
in
this
case
there
is
nothing
in
the
external
conditions
of
life
to
cause
the
reappearance
of
the
slaty
blue
with
the
several
marks
beyond
the
influence
of
the
mere
act
of
crossing
on
the
laws
of
inheritance
no
doubt
it
is
very
surprising
fact
that
characters
should
reappear
after
having
been
iost
for
many
perhaps
for
hundreds
of
generations
but
when
breed
has
been
crossed
only
once
by
some
other
breed
the
offspring
oc
casionally
show
tendency
to
revert
in
character
to
the
foreign
breed
for
many
generations—some
say
for
dozen
or
even
score
of
generations
after
twelve
generations
the
proportion
of
blood
to
use
common
expression
of
omar
v
laws
of
variation
145
any
one
ancestor
is
only
in
2048
and
yet
as
we
see
it
is
generally
believed
that
tendency
to
reversion
is
re
tained
by
this
very
small
proportion
of
foreign
blood
in
breed
which
has
not
been
crossed
but
in
which
dota
parents
have
lost
some
character
which
their
progenitor
sossessed
the
tendency
whether
strong
or
weak
to
repro
uce
the
lost
character
might
be
as
was
formerly
remark
cd
for
all
that
we
can
see
to
the
contrary
transmitted
for
almost
any
number
of
generations
hen
character
which
has
been
lost
in
breed
reappears
after
great
number
of
generations
the
most
probable
hypothesis
is
not
that
the
offspring
suddenly
takes
after
an
ancestor
some
hundred
generations
distant
but
that
in
each
succes
sive
generation
there
has
been
tendency
to
reproduce
the
character
in
question
which
at
last
under
unknown
favourable
conditions
gains
an
ascendancy
for
instance
it
is
probable
that
in
each
generation
of
the
barb-pigeon
whicﬁ
produces
most
rarely
blue
and
black-barred
bird
there
has
been
tendency
in
each
generation
in
the
plu
mage
to
assume
this
colour
this
view
is
hypothetical
but
could
be
supported
by
some
facts
and
can
see
no
more
abstract
improbability
in
tendency
to
produce
any
character
being
inherited
for
an
endless
number
of
gener
ations
than
in
quite
useless
or
rudimentary
organs
being
as
we
all
know
them
to
be
thus
inherited
indeed
we
may
sometimes
observe
mere
tendency
to
produce
rudi
ment
inherited
for
instance
in
the
common
snap-dragon
antirrhinum
rudiment
of
fifth
stamen
so
often
ap
pears
that
this
plant
must
have
an
inherited
tendency
to
produce
it
as
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
are
supposed
on
my
theory
to
have
descended
from
common
parent
it
might
be
expected
that
they
would
occasionally
vary
in
an
analogous
manner
so
that
variety
of
one
species
would
resemble
in
some
of
its
characters
another
species
this
other
species
being
on
my
view
only
well-marked
and
eermunent
variety
but
characters
thus
gained
would
probably
be
of
an
unimportant
nature
for
the
presence
of
all
important
characters
will
be
governed
by
natural
selection
in
accordance
with
the
diverse
habits
of
146
laws
of
variation
omar
v
the
species
and
will
not
be
left
to
the
mutual
actions
of
the
condition
of
life
and
of
similar
inherited
constitu
tion
it
might
further
be
expected
that
the
species
of
the
same
genus
would
occasionally
exhibit
reversions
to
lost
ancestral
characters
as
however
we
never
know
the
exact
character
of
the
common
ancestor
of
group
we
could
not
distinguish
these
two
cases
if
for
instance
we
did
not
know
that
the
rock-pigeon
was
not
feather-footed
or
turn-crowned
we
could
not
have
told
whether
these
characters
in
our
domestic
breeds
were
reversions
or
only
analogous
variations
but
we
might
have
inferred
that
the
blueness
was
case
of
reversion
from
the
number
of
the
markings
which
are
correlated
with
the
blue
tint
and
which
it
does
not
appear
probable
would
all
appear
to
eether
from
simple
variation
more
especially
we
might
ave
inferred
this
from
the
blue
colour
and
marks
often
appearing
when
distinct
breeds
of
diverse
colours
are
crossed
hence
though
under
nature
it
must
generally
be
left
doubtful
what
cases
are
reversions
to
an
anciently
existing
character
and
what
are
new
but
analogous
varia
tions
yet
we
ought
on
my
theory
sometimes
to
find
the
varying
offspring
of
species
assuming
characters
either
from
reversion
or
from
analogous
variation
which
already
occur_in
some
other
members
of
the
same
group
and
this
undoubtedly
is
the
case
in
nature
considerable
part
of
the
difficulty
in
recognising
variable
species
in
our
systematic
works
is
due
to
its
varieties
mocking
as
it
were
some
of
the
other
species
of
the
same
genus
considerable
catalogue
also
could
be
given
of
forms
intermediate
between
two
other
forms
which
themselves
must
be
doubtfully
ranked
as
either
varieties
or
species
and
this
shows
unless
all
these
forms
be
considered
as
independently
created
species
that
the
one
in
varying
has
assumed
some
of
the
characters
of
the
other
go
as
to
produce
the
intermediate
form
but
the
best
evidence
is
afforded
by
parts
or
organs
of
an
impor
tant
and
uniform
nature
occasionally
varying
so
as
to
ac
quire
in
some
degree
the
character
of
the
same
part
or
organ
in
an
allied

collected

of
such

am
aware
that
colonel
hamilton
smith
who
has
written
on
this
subject
believes
that
the
several
breeds
of
the
horse
have
descended
from
several
aboriginal
species
one
of
which
the
dun
was
striped
and
that
the
above
described
a.pi
arances
are
all
due
to
ancient
crosses
with
the
dun
stock
but
am
not
at
all
satisfied
with
this
theory
and
should
be
loth
to
apply
it
to
breeds
so
distinct
as
the

turn
to

that

been
the
product
of

the

were
much
more
plainly
barred
than
the
rest
of

in

of

there
was

in

more

the

this

another
most
remarkable
case

he
informs
me
that
he
knows
of

case
from

this
hybrid
though
the
ass
seldom
has
stripes
on
its
legs
and
the
hemionus
has
none
and
has
not
even
shoulder-stripe
nevertheless
had
all
four
legs
barred

had
three
short
shoulder-stripes

even
had
some
zebra-like
stripes
on
the
sides
of
its

with
respect
to
this
last
fact
was
so
convinced
that
not
even
stripe
of
colour
appears
from
what
would
com
monly
be
called
an
accident
that
was
led
solely
from
the
occurrence
of
the
facestﬁf)es
on
this

from

to
ask
colonel

whether
such

stripes
ever
occur
in
the
eminently
striped
kattywar
breed
of
horses
and
was
as
we
have
seen
answered
in
the
affirmative
what
now
are
we
to
say
to
these
several
facts
we
see
several
very
distinct
species
of
the
horse-genus
becom
ing
by
simple

striped
on
the

like
zebra
or
striped

hike
an

the
horse
wo
see
this
tendency
strong
whenever
dun
tint
appears—a
tint
which
approaches
to
that
of
the
general
colouring
of
the
other
species
of
the
genus
the
appearance
of
the
stripes
is
not
accompam'egc
by
any
change
of
form
or
by
any
other
new
character
we
sce
this
tendency
to
be
come
striped
most
strongly
displayed
in
hybrids
from
be
tween
several
of
the
most
distinct
species
now
observe
the
case
of
the
several
breeds
of
pigeons
they
are
de
scended
from
pigeon
includng
two
or
three
sub-species
or
geographical
races
of
bluish
colour
with
certain
bars
and
other
marks
and
when
any
breed
assumes
by
simple
variation
bluish
tint
these
bars
and
other
marka
invariably
reappear
but
without
any
other
change
of
150
laws
of

cmr
v
form
or
character
when
the
oldest
and
truest
breeds
of
various
colours
are
crossed
we
see
strong
tendency
for
the
blue
tint
and
bars
and
marks
to
reapgear
in
the
mon
grels
have
stated
that
the
most
probable
hypothesis
to
account
for
the
reappearance
of
very
ancient
characters
is—that
there
is
fendency
in
the
young
of
each
succes
sive
generation
to
produce
the
long-lost
character
and
that
this
tendency
eom
unknown
causes
sometimes
pre
vails
and
we
have
just
seen
that
in
several
species
of
the
horse-genus
the
stripes
are
either
plainer
or
a
more
commonly
in
the
young
than
in
the
old
call
the
breeds
of
pigeons
some
of
which
have
bred

for

turies
species
and
how
exactly
parallel
is
the
case
with
that
of
the
species
of
the
horse-genus
formyself
ven
ture
confidently
to
look
back
thousands
on
thousands
of
generations
and
see
an
animal
striped
like
zebra
but
perhaps
otherwise
very
differently
constructed
the
com
mon
parent
of
our
domestic
horse
whether
or
not
it
be
descended
from
one
or
more
wild
stocks
of
the
ass
the
hemionus
quaggs
and
zebra
he
who
believes
that
each
equine
species
was
inde
pendently
created
will
presume
assert
that
each
spe
cies
has
been
created
with
tendency
to
vary
both
under
nature
and
under
domestication
in
this
particular
manner
so
a8
often
to
become
striped
like
other
species
of
the
genus
and
that
each
has
been
created
with
strong
tendency
when
crossed
with
species
inhabiting
distant
uarters
of
the
world
to
produce
hybrids
resembling
in
their
stripes
not
their
own
parents
but
other
species
of
the
genus
to
admit
this
view
is
as
it
seems
to
me
to
reject
real
for
an
unreal
or
at
least
for
an
unknown
cause
it
makes
the
works
of
god
mere
mockery
and
deception
would
almost
as
soon
believe
with
the
old
and
ignorant
cosmogonists
that
fossil
shells
had
never
lived
but
had
been
created
in
stone
so
as
to
mock
the
shells
now
living
on
the
sea-shore
summary.—our
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
variation
is
profound
not
in
one
case

whenever

the

to
have

hard
parts
and
in
external
parts
sometimes
affect

and
internal

when
one
part
is
largely
developed
perhaps
it
tends
to
draw
nouris]?ment
from
the
adjoinin
parts
and
every
part
of
the
structure
which
can
be

without
detriment
to
the

be

changes
of
structure
at
an
early
age
will
generally
affect
parts
subsequently
developed
and
there
are
very
many
other
correlations
of
growth
the
nature
of
which
we
are
utterly
unable
to
understand
multiple
parts
are
variable
in
number
and
in
structure
perhaps
arising
from
such
arts
not
having
been
closely
specialised
to
any
particular
unction
80
that
their
modifications
have
not
been
closel
checked
by
natural
selection
it
is
probably
from
this
same
cause
that
organic
beings
low
in
the
scale
of
nature
are
more
variable
than
those
which
have
their
whole
organisation
more
specialised
and
are
higher
in
the
scale
rudimentary
organs
from
being
useless
will
be
dis
regarded
by
natural
selection
and
hence
probably
are
variable
specific
characters—that
is
the
characters
which
have
come
to
differsince
the
several
species
of
the
same
genus
branched
off
from
common
parent—are
more
variable
than
generic
characters
or
those
which
have
long
been
inherited
and
have
not
differed
within
this
same
period
in
these
remarks
we
have
referred
to
special
parts
or
organs
being
still
variable
because
they
have
recently
varied
and
thus
come
to
differ
but
we
have
also
seen
in
the
second
chapter
that
the
same
principle
applies
159
laws
of
variation
cmar
v
to
the
whole
individual
for
in
district
where
many
species
of
any
genus
are
found—that
is
where
there
has
been
much
former
variation
and
differentiation
or
where
the
manufactory
of
new
specific
forms
has
been
actively
at
work—there
on
an
average
we
now
find
most
varieties
or
incipient
species
secondary
sexual
characters
are
highly
variable
and
such
characters
differ
much
in
the
species
of
the
same
toup
variability
in
the
same
parts
of
the
organisation
has
generally
been
taken
advantage
of
in
giving
secondary
sexnal
differences
to
the
sexes
of
the
same
species
and
specific
differences
to
the
several
species
of
the
same
genus
any
part
or
organ
developed
to
an
extraordinary
size
or
in
an
extraordinary
manner
in
comparison
with
the
same
eart
or
organ
in
the
allied
species
must
have
gone
through
an
extraordinary
amount
of
modification
since
the
genus
arose
and
thus
we
can
understand
why
it
should
o%ten
still
be
variable
in
much
higher
degree
than
other
parts
for
variation
is
long
continued
and
slow
process
and
natural
selection
will
in
such
cases
not
as
yet
have
had
time
to
overcome
the
tendency
to
further
variability
and
to
reversion
to
less
modiﬁeg
state
but
when
species
with
any
extra
ordinarily-developed
organ
has
become
the
parent
of
many
modified
descendants—which
on
my
view
must
be
very
slow
process
requiring
long
lapse
of
time—in
this
case
natural
selection
may
readily
have
succeeded
in
giving
fixed
character
to
the
organ
in
however
extraordinary
manner
it
may
be
developed
species
inheriting
nearly
the
same
constitution
from
common
parent
and
exposed
to
similar
influences
will
naturally
tend
to
present
ana
logous
variations
and
these
same
species
may
occasionally
revert
to
some
of
the
characters
o¥
their
ancient
progen
itors
although
new
and
important
modifications
ma
not
arise
from
reversion
and
analogous
variation
suc
modifications
will
add
to
the

and

the
cause
may
be
of

of

the

some
of

are
so
grave
that
to
this
day
can
never
reflect
on
them
without
being
stagﬁered
but
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
the

number
are
onl

those
that
are
real
are
not

fatal

my
theory
i{gese
difficulties
and
objections
mffy
be
classed
under
the
following
heads
firstly
why
if
species
have
de
scended
from
other
species
by
insensibly
fine
gradations
do
we
not
everywhere
see
innumerable
transitional
forms§
why
is
not
all
nature
in
confusion
instead
of
the
species
beinsg
as
we
see
them
well
defined
econdly
is
it
possible
that
an
animal
having
for
instance
the
structure
and
habits
of
bat
could
have
been
formed
by
the
modification
of
some
animal
with
wholly
different
habits
can
we
believe
that
natural
selection
could
%roduce
on
the
one
hand
organs
of
trifling
importance
such
as
the
tail
of
giraffe
which
serves
as
fly-flapper
and
on
the
other
hand
organs
of
such
wonderful
structure
as
the
eye
of
which
we
hardly
as
yet
fully
understand
the
inimitable
perfection
irdly
can
instincts
be
acquired
and
modified
through
natural
selection
what
shall
we
say
to
so
marvellous
cmr
vl
transitional
varieties
158
an
instinct
as
that
which
leads
the
bee
to
meake
cells
which
have
practically
anticipated
the
discoveries
of
pro
found
mathematicians
fourthly
how
can
we
account
for
species
when
crossed
being
sterile
and
producin%
sterile
offspring
whereas
when
varieties
are
crossed
their
fertility
is
unimpaired
the
two
first
heads
shall
be
here
discussed—instinct
and
hybridism
in
separate
chapters
on
the
absence
or
rarity
of
transitional
varieties—as
natural
selection
acts
solely
by
the
preservation
of
profit
able
modifications
each
new
form
will
tend
in
a’fully
stocked
country
to
take
the
place
of
and
finally
to
exter
minate
its
own
less
improved
parent
or
other
less-favoured
forms
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
thus
ex
tinction
and
natural
selection
will
as
we
have
seen
go
hand
in
hand
hence
if
we
look
at
each
species
as
descended
from
some
other
unknown
form
both
the
parent
and
all
the
transitional
varieties
will
generally
have
been
exterminated
by
the
very
process
of
formation
and
per
fection
of
the
new
form
baut
as
by
this
theory
innumerable
transitional
forms
must
have
existed
why
do
we
not
find
them
embedded
in
countless
numbers
the
crust
of
the
earth
it
will
be
much
more
convenient
to
discuss
this
question
in
the
chapter
on
the
imperfection
of
the
geological
record
and
will
here
only
state
that
believe
the
answer
mainl
lies
in
the
record
being
incomparably
less
perfect
than
18
enerally
supposed
the
imperfection
of
the
record
being
chiefly
due
to
organic
beings
not
inhabiting
profoun
degths
of
the
sea
and
to
their
remains
being
embedded
and
preserved
to
future
age
only
in
masses
of
sediment
sufficiently
thick
and
extensive
to
withstand
an
enormous
amount
of
future
degradation
and
such
fossiliferous
masses
can
be
accumulated
only
where
much
sediment
is
deposited
on
the
shallow
bed
of
the
sea
whilst
it
slowly
subsides
these
contingencies
will
concur
only
rarely
and
after
enormously
long
intervals
whilst
the
bed
the
sea
is
stationary
or
is
rising
or
when
very
little
sedis
ment
is
being
deposited
there
will
be

156
difficulties
on

oxar
vl
logical
history
the
crust
of
the
earth
is
vast
musenm
but
the
natural
collections
have
been
made
only
at
inter
vals
of
time
immensely
remote
but
it
may
be
urged
that
when
several
closely-allied
species
inhabit
the
same
territory
we
surely
ought
to
find
at
the
present
time
many
transitional
forms
let
us
take
simple
case
in
travelling
from
north
to
south
over
continent
we
generally
meet
at
successive
intervals
with
closely
allied
or
representative
species
evidently
filli
nearly
the
same
place
in
the
natiral
economy
of
the
lan
these
representative
species
often
meet
and
interlock
and
as
the
one
becomes
rarer
and
rarer
the
other
becomes
more
and
more
frequent
till
the
one
replaces
the
other
but
if
we
compare
these
species
where
they
intermingle
they
are
generally
as
absolutely
distinct
from
each
other
in
every
detail
of
structure
as
are
specimens
taken
from
the
metropolis
inhabited
by
each
by
my
theory
these
allied
species
have
descended
from
common
parent
and
during
the
process
of
modification
each
has
become
adapted
to
the
conditions
of
life
of
its
own
region
and
has
supplanted
and
exterminated
its
original
parent
and
all
the
transitional
varieties
between
its
past
and
present
states
hence
we
ought
not
to
expect
at
the
present
time
to
meet
with
numerous
transitional
varieties
in
each
region
thox:lg]h
they
must
have
existed
there
and
may
be
embedded
there
in
fossil
condition
but
in
the
inter
mediate
region
having
intermediate
conditions
of
life
why
do
we
not
now
find
closely-linking
intermediate
varieties
this
difficulty
for
long
time
quite
confounded
me
but
think
it
can
be
in
large
part
explained
in
the
first
place
we
should
ee
extremely
cautious
in
inferring
because
an
area
is
now
continuous
that
it
has
been
continuous
during
long
period
geology
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
almost
every
continent
has
been
broken
up
into
islands
even
during
the
later
tertiary
eeriods
and
in
such
islands
distinet
species
might
have
een
separately
formed
without
the
possibility
of
inter
mediate
varieties
existing
in
the
intermediate
zones
by
changes
in
the
form
of
the
land
and
of
climate
marine
areas
now
continuous
must
often
have
existed
within
cmar
v1
transitional
varieties
157
recent
times
in
far
less
continuous
and
uniform
condition
than
at
present
but
will
%ass
over
this
way
of
esca
ing
from
the
difficulty
for
believe
that
many
perfectly
defined
species
have
been
formed
on
strictly
continuous
areas
though
do
not
doubt
that
the
formerly
broken
condition
of
areas
now
continuous
has
played
an
impor
tant
part
in
the
formation
of
new
species
more
especially
with
freely-crossing
and
wandering
animals
in
looking
at
species
as
they
are
now
distributed
over
wide
area
we
generally
find
them
tolerably
numerous
over
large
territory
then
becoming
somewhat
abruptly
rarer
and
rarer
on
lt.{e
confines
and
finally
disappearing
hence
the
neutral
territory
between
two
representative
species
is
generally
narrow
in
comparison
with
the
terri
tory
proper
to
each
we
see
the
same
fact
in
ascending
mountains
and
sometimes
it
is
quite
remarkable
how
abruptly
as
alph
de
candolle
has
observed
common
alpine
species
disappears
the
same
fact
has
been
noticed
by
forﬁes
in
sounding
the
depths
of
the
sea
with
the
dredge
to
those
who
look
at
climate
and
the
physical
conditions
of
life
as
the
all-important
elements
of
distri
bution
these
facts
ought
to
cause
surprise
as
climate
and
height
or
depth
graduate
away
insensibly
but
when
we
bear
in
min?that
almost
every
species
even
in
its
metro
polis
would
increase
immense]z
in
numbers
were
it
not
for
other
competing
species
that
nearly
all
either
prey
on
or
gerve
as
prey
for
others
in
short
that
each
organic
being
is
either
directly
or
indirectly
related
in
the
most
important
manner
to
other
organic
beings
we
must
see
that
the
range
of
the
inhabitants
of
any
country
by
no
means
exclusively
depends
on
insensibly
changing
t?bhﬁical
conditions
but
in
large
part
on
the
presence
of
other
spe
cies
on
which
it
depends
or
by
which
it
is
destroyed
or
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
and
as
these
spe
cies
are
already
defined
objects
however
they
may
have
become
s0
not
blending
one
into
another
by
insensible
gradations
the
range
of
any
one
species
depending
as
it
oes
on
the
range
of
others
will
tend
to
be
sharply
de
fined
moreover
each
species
on
the
confines
of
its
range
where
it
exists
in
lessened
numbers
will
during
158
difficulties
on
theory
ozar
vl
fluctuations
in
the
number
of
its
enemies
or
of
its
prey
or
in
the
seasons
be
extremely
liable
to
utter
extermina
tion
and
thus
its
geographical
range
will
come
to
be
still
more
sharply
dehnegf
am
right
in
believing
that
allied
or
representative
species
when
inhabiting
continuvus
area
are
tﬁenemlly
so
distributed
that
each
has
wide
range
with
com
paratively
narrow
neutral
territory
between
them
in
which
they
become
rather
suddenly
rarer
and
rarer
then
a8
varieties
do
not
essentially
differ
from
species
the
same
rule
will
probably
apply
to
both
and
if
we
in
imagina
tion
adapt
varying
species
to
very
large
area
we
shall
have
to
adapt
two
varieties
to
two
large
areas
and
third
variety
to
narrow
intermediate
zone
the
intermediate
variety
consequently
will
exist
in
lesser
numbers
from
inhabiting
narrow
and
lesser
area
and
practically
as
far
as
can
make
out
this
rule
holds
good
with
varieties
in
state
of
nature
have
met
with
striking
instances
of
the
rule
in
the
case
of
varieties
intermediate
between
well-marked
varieties
in
the
genus
balanus
and
it
would
e};ear
from
information
given
me
by
mr
watson
dr
gray
and
mr
wollaston
that
generally
when
varie
ties
intermediate
between
two
other
forms
occur
they
are
much
rarer
numerically
than
the
forms
which
they
connect
now
if
we
may
trust
these
facts
and
inferences
and
therefore
conclude
h{at
varieties
linking
two
other
varieties
together
have
generally
existed
in
lesser
numbers
than
the
forms
which
they
connect
then
think
we
can
understand
why
intermediate
varieties
should
not
endure
for
very
long
periods
why
as
general
rule
they
should
be
exterminated
and
disappear
sooner
than
the
forms
which
they
originally
linked
together
for
any
form
existing
in
lesser
numbers
would
as
ulready
remarked
run
greater
chance
of
being
exter
minated
than
one
existing
in
large
numbers
and
in
this
articular
case
the
intermediate
form
would
be
eminently
able
to
the
inroads
of
closely
allied
forms
existing
on
both
sides
of
it
but
far
more
important
consideration
a8
believe
is
that
during
the
process
of
further
modifi
cation
by
which
two
varieties
are
supposed
on
my
theory
omar
vl
transitional
varieties
159
to
be
converted
and
perfected
into
two
distinct
species
the
two
which
exist
in
larger
numbers
from
inhabiting
larger
areas
will
have
great
advantage
over
the
inter
me%?ate
variety
which
exists
in
smaller
numbers
in
narrow
and
intermediate
zone
for
forms
existing
in
larger
numbers
will
always
have
better
chance
within
any
given
period
of
presenting
further
favourable
varia
tions
for
natural
selection
to
seize
on
than
will
the
rarer
forms
which
exist
in
lesser
numbers
hence
the
more
common
forms
in
the
race
for
life
will
tend
to
beat
and
supplant
the
less
common
forms
for
these
will
be
more
slowly
modified
and
improved
it
is
the
same
principle
which
as
believe
accounts
for
the
common
species
in
each
country
as
shown
in
the
second
chapter
presenting
on
an
average
greater
number
of
well-marked
varieties
than
do
the
rarer
species
may
illustrate
what
mean
by
su}})osing
three
varieties
of
sheep
to
be
kept
one
adapted
to
an
extensive
mountainous
region
second
to
comparatively
narrow
hilly
tract
and
third
to
wide
plains
at
the
base
and
that
the
inhabitants
are
all
trying
with
equal
steadiness
and
skill
to
improve
their
stocks
by
selection
the
chances
in
this
case
will
be
strongly
in
favour
of
the
great
holders
on
the
mountains
or
on
the
elains
improving
their
breeds
more
quickly
than
the
small
olders
on
the
intermediate
narrow
hilly
tract
and
conse
quently
the
improved
mountain
or
plain
breed
will
soon
take
the
place
of
the
less
improved
hill
breed
and
thus
the
two
breeds
which
origina{ly
existed
in
greater
num
bers
will
come
into
close
contact
with
each
other
with
out
the
interposition
of
the
supplanted
intermediate
hill
variety
to
sum
up
believe
that
species
come
to
be
tolerably
well-defined
objects
and
do
not
at
any
one
period
present
an
inextricable
chaos
of
varying
and
intermediate
links
firstly
because
new
varieties
are
very
slowly
formed
for
variation
is
very
slow
process
and
natural
selection
can
do
nothing
until
favourable
variations
chance
to
occur
and
until
place
in
the
natural
polity
of
the
country
can
be
better
ﬁl})ed
by
some
modification
of
some
one
or
mnore
of
it
inhabitants
and
such
new
places
will
depend
on
160
difficulties
on
theory
cur
vl
slow
ch
of
climate
or
on
the
occasional
immigration
of
new
inhabitants
and
probably
in
still
more
impor
tant
degree
on
some
of
the
old
inhabitants
becoming
slowly
modified
with
the
new
forms
thus
produced
and
the
old
ones
acting
and
reacting
on
each
other
so
that
in
any
one
region
and
at
any
one
time
we
ought
only
to
see
few
species
presenting
slight
modifications
of
struc
ture
in
some
degree
permanent
and
this
assuredly
we
see
secondly
areas
now
continuous
must
often
have
ex
isted
within
the
recent
period
in
isolated
portions
in
which
many
forms
more
especially
amongst
the
classes
which
unite
for
each
birth
and
wander
much
may
have
separately
been
rendered
sufficiently
distinct
to
rank
as
representative
species
in
this
case
intermediate
varieties
between
the
several
representative
species
and
their
com
mon
parent
must
formerly
have
existed
in
each
broken
portion
of
the
land
but
these
links
will
have
been
sup
planted
and
exterminated
durinq
the
process
of
natural
selection
so
that
they
will
no
longer
exist
in
living
state
thirdly
when
two
or
more
varieties
have
been
formed
in
different
portions
of
strictly
continuous
area
inter
mediate
varieties
will
it
is
probable
at
first
have
been
formed
in
the
intermediate
zones
but
they
will
generall
have
had
short
duration
for
these
intermediate
vari
eties
will
from
reasons
already
assigned
namely
from
what
we
know
of
the
actual
distribution
of
closely
allied
or
representative
species
and
likewise
of
acknowledged
varieties
exist
in
the
intermediate
zones
in
lesser
num
bers
than
the
varieties
which
they
tend
to
connect
from
this
cause
alone
the
intermediate
varieties
will
be
liable
to
accidental
extermination
and
during
the
process
of
fur
ther
modification
through
natural
selection
they
will
almost
certainly
be
beaten
and
supplanted
by
the
forms
which
they
connect
for
these
from
existing
in
greater
numbers
will
in
the
aggregate
present
more
variation
and
thus
be
further
improved
through
natural
selection
and
gain
further
advantages
lastly
looking
not
to
any
one
time
but
to
all
time
if

161
my
theory
be
true
numberless
intermediate
varieties
link
ing
most
closely
all
the
species
of
the
same
group
together
must
assuredly
have
existed
but
the
very
process
of
natural
selection
constantly
tends
as
has
been
so
often
re
marked
to
exterminate
the
parent-forms
and
the
inter
mediate
links
consequently
evidence
of
their
fomer
ex
istence
could
be
found
only
amongst
fossil
remains
which
are
preserved
as
we
shall
in
future
chapter
attempt
to
show
in
an
extremely
imperfect
and
intermittent
record
on
the
origin
and
transitions
of
organic
beings
with
peculiar
habits
and
structure—1it
has
been
asked
by
the
opponents
of
such
views
as
hold
how
for
instance
land
carnivorous
animal
could
have
been
converted
into
one
with
aquatic
habits
for
how
could
the
animal
in
its
transitional
state
have
subsisted
it
would
be
easy
to
show
that
within
the
same
group
carnivorous
animals
ex
ist
having
every
intermediate
grade
between
truly
aquatic
and
strictly
terrestrial
habits
and
as
each
exists
by
struggle
for
life
it
is
clear
that
each
is
well
adapted
in
ts
hsﬁ)its
to
its
place
in
nature
look
at
the
mustela
vison
of
north
america
which
has
webbed
feet
and
which
resembles
an
otter
in
its
fur
short
legs
and
form
of
tail
during
summer
this
animal
dives
for
and
preys
on
fish
but
during
the
long
winter
it
leaves
the
frozen
waters
and
preys
like
other
pole-cats
on
mice
and
land
animals
different
case
had
been
taken
and
it
had
been
asked
how
an
insectivorous
quadruped
could
pos
sibly
have
been
converted
into
flying
bat
the
question
would
have
been
far
more
difficult
and
could
have
given
no
a.l;lswer
yet
think
such
difficulties
have
very
little
weight
ere
as
on
other
occasions
lie
under
heavy
dis
advantage
for
out
of
the
many
striking
cases
which
have
collected
can
give
only
one
or
two
instances
of
traneitional
habits
and
structures
in
closely
allied
species
of
the
same
genus
and
of
diversified
habits
either
con
stant
or
occasional
in
the
same
species
and
it
scems
to
me
that
nothing
less
than
long
list
of
such
cases
is
suf
ficient
to
lessen
the
difficulty
in
any
particular
case
like
that
of
the
bat
162
difficulties
on
theory
our
vl
look
at
the
family
of
squirrels
here
we
have
the
finest
gradation
from
animals
with
their
tails
only
slightly
flattened
and
from
others
as
sir
j
richardson
has
re
marked
with
the
posterior
part
of
their
bodies
rather
wide
and
with
the
skin
on
their
flanks
rather
full
to
the
so-called
flying
squirrels
and
flying
squirrels
have
their
limbs
and
even
the
base
of
the
tail
united
by
broad
ex
panse
of
skin
which
serves
as
parachute
and
allows
them
to
glide
through
the
air
to
an
astonishing
distance
from
tree
to
tree
we
cannot
doubt
that
each
structure
is
of
use
to
each
kind
of
squirrel
in
its
own
country
by
enabling
it
to
escape
birds
or
beasts
of
prey
or
to
collect
food
more
quickly
or
as
there
is
reason
to
believe
by
lessening
the
danger
from
occasional
falls
but
it
does
not
follow
from
this
fact
that
the
structure
of
each
mﬁuirrel
is
the
best
that
it
is
possible
to
conceive
under
all
natural
conditions
let
the
climate
and
vegetation
change
let
other
competing
rodents
or
new
beasts
of
prey
immigrate
or
old
ones
become
modified
and
all
analog
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
some
at
least
of
the
squirrels
would
decrease
in
numbers
or
become
exterminated
un
less
they
also
became
modified
and
improved
in
structure
in
corresponding
manner
therefore
can
see
no
dif
ficulty
more
especially
under
changing
conditions
of
life
in
the
continued
preservation
of
individuals
with
fuller
and
fuller
lank-membranes
each
modification
being
use
ful
each
being
propagated
until
by
the
accumulated
effects
of
this
process
of
natural
selection
perfect
so
called
flying
squirrel
was
produced
now
look
at
the
galeopithecus
or
flying
lemur
which
formerly
was
falsely
rankeg
amongst
bats
it
has
an
ex
tremely
wide
flank-membrane
stretching
from
the
corners
of
the
jaw
to
the
tail
and
including
the
limbs
and
the
elongated
fingers
the
flank-membrane
is
also
furnished
with
an
extensor
muscle
although
no
graduated
links
of
structure
fitted
for
gliding
through
the
air
now
con
nect
the
galeopithecus
with
the
other
lemuridw
yet
can
see
no
difficulty
in
supposing
that
such
links
formerly
existed
and
that
each
hag
been
formed
by
the
same
steps
a8
in
the
case
of
the
less
perfectly
gliding
squirrels
and
oz
vl
transitional
habits
163
that
each
of
structure
had
been
useful
to
its
pos
sessor
nor
can
see
any
insuperable
difficulty
in
fur
ther
believing
it
possible
that
the
membrane-connected
fingers
and
fore-arm
of
the
galeopithecus
might
be
greatly
lengthened
by
natural
selection
and
this
as
far
as
the
organs
of
flight
are
concerned
would
convert
it
into
bat
in
bats
which
have
the
wing-membrane
ex
tended
from
the
top
of
the
shoulder
to
the
tail
including
the
hind-legs
we
perhaps
see
traces
of
an
apparatus
orig
l;_nall
l-fnstructed
for
gliding
through
the
air
rather
than
or
flight
if%.bout
dozen
genera
of
birds
had
become
extinct
or
were
unknown
who
would
have
ventured
to
have
sur
mised
that
birds
might
have
existed
which
used
their
wings
solely
as
flappers
like
the
logger-headed
duck
micropterus
of
eyion
as
fins
in
the
water
and
front
legs
on
the
land
like
the
penguin
as
sails
like
the
ostrich
and
functionally
for
no
purpose
like
the
apteryx
yet
the
structure
of
each
of
these
birds
is
good
for
it
under
the
conditions
of
life
to
which
it
is
exposed
for
each
has
to
live
by
struggle
but
it
is
not
necessarily
the
best
possible
under
all
possible
conditions
it
must
not
be
inferred
from
these
remarks
that
any
of
the
grades
of
wing-structure
here
alluded
to
which
perhaps
may
all
have
resulted
from
disuse
indicate
the
natural
steps
by
which
birds
have
acquired
their
perfect
onwer
of
flight
;
but
they
serve
at
least
to
show
what
iversified
means
of
transition
are
possible
seeing
that
few
members
of
such
water-breathing
classes
as
the
crustacea
and
mollusca
are
adapted
to
live
on
the
land
and
seeing
that
we
have
flying
birds
and
mammals
flying
insects
of
the
most
diversified
types
and
formerly
had
flying
reptiles
it
is
conceivable
that
flying
fish
which
now
glide
}f)'a.r
through
the
air
s]ightli
rising
and
turning
by
the
aid
of
their
guttering
fins
might
bave
been
modiged
into
perfectly
winged
animals
if
this
tad
been
effected
who
would
have
ever
imagined
that
in
an
early
transitional
state
they
had
been
inhabitants
of
the
open
ocean
and
had
used
their
incipient
organs
of
flight
exclusively
as
far
as
we
know
to
escape
being
devoured
by
other
fish
164
difficulties
on
theory
caar
v1
when
we
see
any
structure
highl{
perfected
for
any
particular
habit
as
the
wings
of
bird
for
flight
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
animals
displaying
early
tran
sitional
gades
of
the
structure
will
seldom
continue
to
exist
to
the
present
day
for
they
will
have
been
supplant
ed
by
the
very
process
of
perfection
through
natural
se
lection
furthermore
we
may
conclude
that
transitional
grades
between
structures
fitted
for
very
different
habits
of
life
will
rarely
have
been
developed
at
an_early
¥eriod
in
great
numbers
and
under
many
subordinate
forms
thus
to
return
to
our
imaginary
illustration
of
the
flying
fish
it
does
not
seem
probable
that
fishes
capable
of
true
flight
would
have
been
developed
under
many
subordi
nate
forms
for
taking
prey
of
many
kinds
in
many
ways
on
the
land
and
in
the
water
until
their
organs
of
flight
had
come
to
high
stage
of
perfection
s0
as
to
have
iven
them
decifed
advantage
over
other
animals
in
the
attle
for
life
hence
the
chance
of
discovering
species
with
transitional
grades
of
structure
in
fossil
condition
will
always
be
less
from
their
having
existed
in
lesser
numbers
than
in
the
case
of
species
with
fully
developed
structures
will
now
give
two
or
three
instances
of
diversified
and
of
changed
habits
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
spe
cies
when
either
case
occurs
it
would
be
easy
for
na
tural
selection
to
fit
the
animal
by
some
modification
of
its
structure
for
its
changed
habits
or
exclusively
for
one
of
its
several
different
habits
but
it
is
difficult
to
tell
and
immaterial
for
us
whether
habits
generally
change
first
and
structure
afterwards
or
whether
slight
modifica
tions
of
structure
lead
to
changed
habits
both
fprol)ably
often
change
almost
simultaneously
of
cases
of
changed
habits
it
will
suffice
merely
to
allude
to
that
of
the

we
might
ex
pect
on
my
theory
that
such

would
occasion

have
given
rise
to
new
species

anomalous

with
their

slightly

from
that
of

such

be

in

what
seems
plainer
than
that
the
long
toes
of
grallatores
are
formed
for
walking
over

and
floating

yet
the
water-hen
is
nearly
as
aquatic
as
the

the

nearly
as

the

be

changed

corresponding

of

the

of
the

may
be
said
to
have
been
rudimentary
in

though
not
in

in
the

the
deeply
scooped
membrane
between
the
toes
shows
that
structure
has
begun
to
change
he
who
believes
in
separate
and
innumerable
acts
of
creation
will
say
that
in
these
cases
it
has
pleased
the
creator
to
cause
being
of
one
type
to
take
the
place
of
one
of
another
type
but
this
seems
to
me
only
restating
the
fact
in
dignified
language
he
who
believes
in
the
struggle
for
existence
and
in
the
principle
of
natural
se
lection
will
acknowledge
that
every
organic
being
is
con
stantly
endeavouring
to
increase
in
numbers
and
that
if
any
one
being
vary
ever
so
little
either
in
habits
or
struc
ture
and
thus
gain
an
advantage
over
some
other

of

it
will
seize
on

that
in

different
it
may

hence
it
will
cause
him
no
aurgrise
that
there
should
be
eese
and
frigate-birds
with
webbed
feet
either
living
on
the
dry
land
or
most
rarely
alighting
on
the
water
that
there
should
be
long-toed
corncrakes
living
in
meadows
instead
of
in
swamps
that
there
should
be
woodpeckers
where
not
tree
grows
that
there
should
be
diving
thrushes
and
petrels
with
the
habits
of
anks

of
extreme

and_complication—to
suppose
that
the

with
all
its
inimitable
contrivances
for
adjusting
the

to
different
distances
for
admit
ing
different
amounts
of
light
and
for
the
correction
of
apierical
and
chromatic
aberration
could
have
been
formed
by
natural
selection
seems
freely
confess
absurd
in
the
highest
possible
degree
yet
reason
tells
me
that
if
numerous
gradations
from
perfect
and
complex
eye
to
one
very
imperfect
and
simple
each
grade
being
use
ful
to
its
possessor
can
be
shown
to
exist
if
further
the
eye
does
vary
ever
so
slightly
and
the
variations
be
in
herited
which
is
certainly
the
case
and
if
any
variation
or
modification
in
the
organ
be
ever
useful
to
an
animal
under
changing
conditions
of
life
then
the
difficulty
of
believing
that
perfect

complex

could
be
formed
by
natural

thongh
insuperable
by
our
imagina
tion
can
hardly
be
considered
real
how
nerve
comes
to
be
sensitive
to
light
hardly
concerns
us
more
than
how
life
itself
first
originated
but
may
remark
that
several
facts
make
me
suspect
that
any
sensitive
nerve
may
be
rendered
sensitive
to
light
and
likewise
to
those
coarser
vibrations
of
the
air
which
produce
sound
in
looking
for
the
gradations
by
which
an
organ
in
any
species
has
been
perfected
we
ought
to
look
exclu
sively
to
its
lineal
ancestors
but
this
is
scarcely
ever
possible
and
we
are
forced
in
each
case
to
look
to
species
of
the
same
group
that
is
to
the
collateral
descendants
from
the
same
original
parent-form
in
order
to
see
what
adations
are
%ossible
and
for
the
chance
of
some
gra

having
been
transmitted
from
the
earlier
stages
of

in
an
unaltered

of

in

of

and
from

we
can
learn
nothing
on
this
head
in
this
great
cf’ass
we
should
probably
have
to
descend
far
beneath
the
lowest
known
fossiliferous
stratum
to
discover
the
earlier

which
the

can

with
an

coated
with

and
without
any

mechanism
and
from
this
low
stage
numerous
gra
dations
of
structure
branching
off
in
two
fundamentally
different
lines
can
be
shown
to
exist
until
we
reach
moderately
high
stage
of
perfection
in
certain
crusta

there
is

divided
into

within

there

and
must
act
by

at

there
seems
to
be
an
imperfect

substance
with
these
facts
here
far
too
briefly

given
which
show
that
there
is
much

in

bearing
in

how
small
the

can
see
no
very
great
difficulty
not
more
than
in
the
case
of
many
other
structures
in
believing
that
natural
selection
has
converted
the
simple
apparatus
of
an
optic
nerve
merely
coated
with
pigment
and
invested
by

any

by

we
look
to
an

common
to
all

for
in
this
latter
case
the
organ
must
have
been
first
formed
at
an
extremely
remote
period
since
which
all
the
many
members
of
the
class
have
been
de

and
in
order
to
discover
the
early
transitional
es
through
which
the

has
passed
we
should
ﬁ:.ve
to
look
to
very
ancient
ancestral
forms
long
since
become

we
should
be
extremely
cautious
in
concluding
that
an
organ
could
not
have
been
formed
by
transitional
grada
tions
of
some

numerous
cases
could
be
given
amongst

the

of
the

and
in
the

in

the

may
be
turned
inside

and
the
ex

surface
will
then
digest
and

such
cases
natural

might
easily
specialise
if

were
thus
gained

had
performed

thus

sometimes
perform

there

this

for

and
being

vascular
partitions
in

cases
one
of

might
with

to
perform
all
the
work
by
itself
being

the

then
this

might
be
modified
for
some
other
and
quite
distinct
purpose
or
be
quite
obliterated
the
illustration
of
the
swimbladder
in
fishes
is
good
one
because
it
shows
us
clearly
the
highly
important
fact
that
an
organ
originally
constructed
for
one
purpose
namely
flotation
may
be
converted
into
one
for
wholly
different
purpose
namely
respiration
the

has
also,];)een

all

in

with

of

hence
there
seems
to
me
to
be
no
great
difficulty
in
believing
that
natural
selection
has
actually
converted
swimbladder
into

or
organ
used

for

can
indeed
hardly

that

from
an
ancient

of
which
we

we
can
thus
as
infer
from
professor
owen’s
interesting
description
of
these

understand
the
strange
fact
that
every
particle
of

which

to
pass
over
the

of
the

beautiful

by

wholly
disap
peared—the

on
the
sides
of
the
neck
and
the
loop-like
course
of
the
arteries
still
marking
in
the
embryo
their
fornfer
position
but
it
is
conceivable
that
the
now
ut
terly
lost
branchis
might
have
been
gradually
worked
in
by
natural
selection
for
some
quite
gi?tinct
purpose
in
the
same
manner
as
on
the
view
entertained
by
some
naturalists
that
the
branchis
and
dorsal
scales
of
annelids
are
homologous
with
the
wings
and
wing-covers
of
insects
it
is
probable
that
organs
which
at
very
ancient
period
served
for
respiration
have
been
actually
conve
into
organs
of
ﬂifht
in
considering
transitions
of
organs
it
is
so
important
to
bear
in
mind
the
probability
of
conversion
from
one
function
to
another
that
will
give
one
more
instance
pedunculated
cirripedes
have
two
minute
folds
of
skin
called
by
me
the
ovigerous
frena
which
serve
through
the
means
of
sticky
secretion
to
retain
the
eggs
until
they
are
hatched
within
the
sack
these
cirripedes
have
no
branchise
the
whole
surface
of
the
hody
and
sack
in
cluding
the
small
frena
serving
for
respiration
the
bahm%.m
or
sessile
cirripedes
on
the
other
hand
have
no
173
diffioulties

ovigerous

the
qus
lyi
eloose
at
the
bottom
of
the
sack
in
the
well-enc
osegus
ell
but
they
have
large
folded
branchi
now
think
no
one
will
dispute
that
the
ovigerous
frena
in
the
one
family
are
strictly
homolo
gous
with
the
branchis
of
the
other
family
indeed
they
uate
into
each
other
therefore
do
not
doubt
that
ittle
folds
of
skin
which
originally
served
as
ovigerous
frena
but
which
likewise
verly
slightly
aided
the
act
of
respiration
have
been
gradually
converted
by
natural
se
lection
into
branchise
simply
through
an
increase
in
their
size
and
the
obliteration
of
their
a(ﬁxesive
glands
if
all
eedunculabed
cirripedes
had
become
extinct
and
they
ave
already
suffered
far
more
extinction
than
have
sessile
cirripedes
who
would
ever
have
imagined
that
the
branchise
in
this
latter
family
had
originally
existed
as
organs
for
preventing
the
ova
from
being
washed
out
of
the
sack
although
we
must
be
extremely
cautious
in
con
cluding
that
any
organ
could
not
possibly
have
been
pro
duced
by
successive
transitionaf
gradations
yet
un
doubtedly
grave
cases
of
difficulty
occur
some
of
which
will
be
discussed
in
my
future
work
one
of
the
gravest
is
that
of
neuter
insects
which
are
often
very
differently
constructed
from
either
the
males
or
fertile
females
but
this
case
will
be
treated
of
in
the
next
chapter
the
electric
organs
of
fishes
offer
another
case
of
special
difficulty
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
by
what
ste(l))s
these
wondrous
organs
have
been
produced
but
as
owen
and
others
have
remarked
their
intimate
structure
closely
resembles
that
of
common
muscle
and
as
it
has
lately
been
sho#n
that
rays
have
an
organ
closely
analogous
to
the
electric
apparatus
and
yet
do
not
a3
matteucci
asserts
discharge
any
electricity
we
must
own
that
we
are
far
too
ignorant
to
argue
that
no
transition
of
any
kind
is
possible
the
electric
organs
offer
another
and
even
more
serious
difficulty
for
they
occur
in
only
about
dozen
fishes
of
which
several
are
widely
remote
in
their
affinities
generally
when
the
same
organ
appears
in
several
mem
bers
of
the
same
class
especially
if
in
members
having
very
different
habits
of
life
we
may
attribute
its
presence
cuar
vl
transitions
of
organs
178
to
inheritance
from
common
ancestor
and
its
absence
in
some
of
the
members
to
its
loss
through
disuse
or
natu
ral
selection
butif
the
electric
organs
had
been
inherited
from
one
ancient
progenitor
thus
provided
we
might
have
expected
that
all
electric
fishes
would
have
been
specially
related
to
each
other
nor
does
geology
at
all
lead
to
the
belief
that
formerly
most
fishes
had
electric
organs
which
most
of
their
modified
descendants
have
lost
the
pres
ence
of
luminous
organs
in
few
insects
belonging
to
different
families
and
orders
offers
parallel
case
of
difficulty
other
cases
could
be
given
for
instance
in
plants
the
very
curious
contrivance
of
mass
of
pollen
grains
borne
on
foot-stalk
with
sticky
gland
at
the
end
is
the
same
in
orchis
and
asclepias,—genera
almost
as
remote
as
possible
amongst
flowering
plants
in
all
these
cases
otp
two
very
distinct
species

with
apparently
the
same
anomalous

some

am
inclined
to
believe
that
in
nearly
the

way
as
two
men
have
sometimes
independentl{ll;it
on
the
very
same
invention
so
natural
selection
working
for
the
good
of
each
being
and
taking
advantage
of
analogous
variations
has
some
times
modified
in
very
nearly
the
same
manner
two
parts
in
two
organic
beings
which
owe
but
little
of
their
struc
ture
in
common
to
inheritance
from
the
same
ancestor
although
in
many
cases
it
is
most
difficult
to
conjecture
by
what
transitions
an
organ
could
have
arrived
at
its
present
state
yet
considering
that
the
proportion
of
liv
ing
and
known
forms
to
the
extinct
and
own
is
very
small
have
been
astonished
how
rarely
an
organ
can
be
named
towards
which
no
transitional
grade
is
known
to
lead
the
truth
of
this
remark-is
indeed
shown
by
that
old
canon
in
natural
history
of
natura
non
facit
saltum
we
meet
with
this
admission
in
the
writings
of
almost
every
experienced
naturalist
or
as
milne
edwards
has
well
expressed
it
nature
is
prodigal
in
variety
but
niggard
in
innovation
why
on
the
tﬁeory
of
creation
should
this
be

why
should
all
the

supposed
to
have

so
invariably

by
graduated
steps
why
should
not
nature
have
taken
leap
from

on
the
theory
of
natural

we
can
clearly
under
stand
why
she
should

act
only
by
taking
advantage
of
slight
successive

can
never

the

of

and
by

of

of

have
sometimes
felt
much
difficulty
in
un
derstanding
the
origin
of
simple
parts
of
which
the
im

does
not
seem
sufficient
to
cause
the
preservation
of

individuals
have
sometimes
felt
as
much
difficulty
though
of
very
different
kind
on
this
head
as
in
the
case
of
an

as
perfect

we
are
much
too
ignorant
in

to
the
whole
economy
of
any

organic

to
say
what
slight
modifications
would
be
of
importance
or
not
in

have
given
instances
of
most
trifling
characters
such
as
the
down

and
the
colour
of
the
flesh
which
from
determining
the
attacks
of
insects
or
from
being
correlated
with
constitutional
differences
might
assuredly
be
acted
on
by
natural
selection
the
tail
of
the
giraffe
looks
like
an
artificially
constructed
fly-flapper
and
it
seems
at
first
incredible
that
this

l}))een
adapted
for
its
present
purpose
by
sucecessive
slight

better

better
for
so
trifling
an

as

yet
we
should
pause
before
bein
too
positive
even
in
this
case
for
we
know
that
the
distri
bution
and
existence
of
cattle
and
other
animals
in
south
america
absolutely
depends
on
their
power
of
resisting
the
attacks
of
insects
so
that
individuals
which
could
by
any
means
defend
themselves
from
these
small
enemies
would
be
able
to

may
sometimes
attribute

that

that

no

that

this

no

is
of
the

service
to

but
as
we
see
nearly
similar
hooks
on
many
trees
which
are
not
climbers
the
hooks
on
the
bamboo
may
have
arisen
from
unknown
laws
of

been

taken

the

80
it
may
be
or
it
may
possibly
be
due
to
the
direct
action
of
putrid
matter
but
we
should
be
very
cautious
in
draw
ing
any
such
inference

for

no

they
facilitate
or
may
be
indispensable
for
this
act
but
as
sutures
occur
in
the
skulls
of
young
birds
and
reptiles
which
have
only
to
escape
from

we
may
infer
that

reflecting
on
the

in
the

my
reasoning
would
appear

foregoing
remarks
lead
me
to
say
few
words
on
est
lately
made
by
some
natura{ists
against
the
an
doctrine
that
every
detail
of
structure
has
been
led
for
the
good
of
its
possessor
they
believe
that
very
many
structures
have
been
created
for
beauty
in
the
178
diffioulties
on
theory
omar
vi
eyes
of
man
or
for
mere
variety
this
doctrine
if
true
would
be
absolutely
fatal
to
my
theory
yet
fully
ad
mit
that
many
structures
are
of
no
direct
use
to
their
pos
sessors
physical
conditions
probably
have
had
some
little
effect
on
structure
quite
independently
of
any
good
thus
gained
correlation
of
growth
has
no
doubt
played
most
important
part
and
useful
modification
of
one
part
will
often
have
entailed
on
other
parts
diversified
changes
of
no
direct
use
so
atga.in
characters
which
for
merly
were
useful
or
which
formerly
had
arisen
from
correlation
of
growth
or
from
other
unknown
cause
may
reappear
from
the
law
of
reversion
though
now
of
no
direct
use
the
effects
of
sexual
selection
when
displayed
in
beauty
to
charm
the
females
can
be
called
useful
only
in
rather
forced
sense
but
by
far
the
most
important
consideration
is
that
the
chief
part
of
the
organisation
of
every
being
is
simply
due
to
inheritance
and
conse
quently
though
each
being
assuredly
is
well
fitted
for
its
place
in
nature
many
structures
now
have
no
direct
rela
tion
to
the
habits
of
life
of
each
species
thus
we
can
hardly
believe
that
the
webbed
feet
of
the
mpland
goose
or
of
the
frigate-bird
are
of
special
use
to
these
birds
we
cannot
believe
that
the
same
bones
in
the
arm
of
the
monkey
in
the
fore
leg
of
the
horse
in
the
wing
of
the
bat
and
in
the
flipper
of
the
seal
are
of
special
use
to
these
animals
may
safely
attribute
these
structures
to
inheritance
but
to
the
progenitor
of
the
upland
goose
and
of
the
frigate-bird
webbed
feet
no
doubt
were
as
use
ful
as
they
now
are
to
the
most
aquatic
of
existing
birds
so
we
may
believe
that
the
progenitor
of
the
seal
had
not
flipper
but
foot
with
five
toes
fitted
for
walking
or
grasping
and
we
may
further
venture
to
believe
that
the
several
bones
in
the
limbs
of
the
monkey
horse
and
bat
which
have
been
inherited
from
common
progenitor
were
formerly
of
more
special
use
to
that
progenitor
or
its
erogenitors
than
they
now
are
to
these
animals
having
such
widely
diversified
habits
therefore
we
may
infer
that
these
several
bones
might
have
been
acquired
through
natural
selection
subjected
formerly
as
now
to
the
sev
eral
laws
of

&c
hence
every
detail
of
structure
in
every
living
creature
making
some
little
allowance
for
the
direct
action
of
physical
conditions
may
be
viewed
either
as
having
been
of
special
use
to
some
ancestral
form
or
as
being
now
of
special
use
to
the
descendants
of
this
form

one’species
incessantly
takes

we
look
at
the

not

its

adapted
to

we
can
perhaps
understand
how
it
is
that
the
use
of
the
sting
should
so
often
cause
the
insect’s
own
death

if
on

will

all
the
requirements
of

though
it
may
cause
the
death
of
some
few

if
we
admire
the
truly
wonderful
power
of
scent
by
which
the
males
of
many
insects
find-their

can
we
admire
the
production
for
this
single

of
thousands
of

are

of

have
in
this
chapter
dis
cussed
some
of
the
difficulties
and
objections
which
may
be
urged
against
my
theory
many
of
them
are
very
grave
but
think
that
in
the
discussion
light
has
been
thrown
on
several
facts
which
on
the
theory
of
independent
acts
of
creation
are
utterly
obscure
we
have
seen
that
spe
cies
at
any
one
period
are
not
indefinitely
variable
and
are
not
linked
together
by
multitude
of
intermediate
gradations
partly%ecanse
the
process
of
natural
selection
will
always
be
very
slow
and
will
act
at
any
one
time
only
on
very
few
forms
and
partly
because
the
very
process
of
natural
selection
almost
implies
the
continual
supglanting
and
extinction
of
preceding
and
intermediate
gradations
closely
allied
species
now
living
on
con
tinuous
area
must
often
have
been
formed
when
the
area
was
not
continuous
and
when
the
conditions
of
life
did
not
ingensibly
graduate
away
from
one
part
to
another
when
two
varieties
are
formed
in
two
districts
of
con
tinuous
area
an
intermediate
variety
will
often
be
formed
fitted
for
an
intermediate
zone
but
from
reasons
assigned
the
intermediate
variety
will
usually
exist
in
lesser
num
bers
than
the
two
forms
which
it
connects
consequently
the
two
latter
during
the
course
of
further
modification
from

in
greater
numbers

have

vantage
over

succeed
in

it
gwe
have
seen
in
this
chapter
how
cautious
we
should
be
in
concluding
that
the
most
different
habits
of
life
could
not
graduate
into
each
other
that
bat
for
instance
could
not
have
been
formed
by
natural
selection
from
an
animal
which
at
first
could
only
glide
through
the
air
we
have
seen
that
species
may
under
new
condi
tions
of
life
change
its
habits
or
have
diversified
habits
with
some
habits
very
unlike
those
of
its
nearest
con
geners
hence
we
can
understand
bearing
in
mind
that
each
organic
being
is
trying
to
live
wherever
it
can
live
how
it
has
arisen
that
there
are
upland
geese
with
webbed
feet

woodpeckers
diving
thrushes
and
petrels
with
the
habits
of
auks
although
the
belief
that
an
organ
so
perfect
as
the
eye
could
have
been
formed
by
natural
selection
is
more
than
enough
to
stagger
any
one
yet
in
the
case
of
any
organ
if
we
know
of
long
series
of
gradations
in
com
plexity
each
good

its
possessor
then
under

there
is

in
the
cases
in
which
we
know
of
no
intermediate

we
should
be
very
cautious
in
concluding
that
none
could
have
existed

the
homologies

for

that

that

of

may
also
believe
that
part
formerly
of
high
importance
has
often
been
retained
as
the
tail
of
an
aquatic
animal
b
its
terrestrial
descendants
though
it
has
become
of
suc
small
importance
that
it
could
not
in
its

state
have
been
acquired
by
natural
selection,—a
power
which
acts
solely
by
the
preservation
of
profitable
variations
in
the
struggle
for
life
natural

will
produce
nothin%lin

for
the

good

injury
of

though
it
may
well
produce

even

highly

but
in
all
cases
at
the

to

owner
natural
selection
in
each
well-stocked
country
must
act
chiefly
through
the
competition
of
the
inhabit
ants
one
with
another
and
consequently
will
produce

to
the

in
the
larger
country
thers
will
have
existed
more

and
the
competition
will
have
been
severer
and
thus
the
standard
of
perfection
will
have
been
rendered
higher
natural
selection
will
not
necessarily
produce
absolute
rfection
nor
as
far
as
we
can
by
our
limited
aculties
can
absolute
perfection
be
everywhere
found
on
the
theory
of

we
can
clearly
understand
the
fgl
meaning
of
that
old
canon
in

history

this
canon
if
we
look
only
to
the
present
inhabitants
of

world
is
not
strictly
correct
but
if
we
include
all
those
of
past
times
it
must
by
my
theory
be
strictly
true
it
is
generally
acknowleged
that
all
organic
beings
have
been
formed
on
two
great
laws—unity
of
type
and
the
conditions
of
existence
by
unity
of
type

meant
that
fandamental
agreement
in
structure
which
we

organic
beinis
of
the
same
class
and
which
is
quite
inde
pendent
of
their
habits
of
life
on
my
theory
unity
of
type
is
explained
by
unity
of
descent
the
expression
of
conditions
of
existence
so
often
insisted
on
by
the
illustrious
cuvier
is
fully
embraced
by
the
principle
of
natural
selection
for
natural
selection
acts
by
either
now
adapting
the
varying
parts
of
each
being
to
its
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
of
life
or
by
having
adapted
them
durinf
long-past
periods

being
aided
in
some
cases
by

slightly

direct
action
of

external
conditions
of

and
being
in

cases
subjected

in

that

will
probably
have
occurred
to
many

a8
difficulty
sufficient
to
overthrow
my
whole
theory
must
premise
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
origin
of
the
primary
mental
powers
any
more
than
have
with
that
ofplife
itself
we
are
concerned
only
with
the
diver
sities
of
instinct
and
of
the
other
mental
qualities
of
ani
mals
within
the
same
class
will
not
attempt
any
definition
of
instinet
it
would
be
easy
to
show
that
several
distinct
mental
actions
are
commonly
embraced
by
this
term
but
every
one
under
stands
what
is
meant
when
it
is
said
that
instinct
impels
the
cuckoo
to
migrate
and
to
lay
her
eggs
in
other
birds
nests
an
action
which
we
ourselves
should
uire
experience
to
enable
us
to
perform
when
performed
by
an
animal
more
especially
by
v?ef
young
one
without
any
experience
andp
when
performed
by
many
individuals
in
the
same
way
without
their
knowing
for
what
purpose
it
is
performed
is
usually
said
to
be
instinctive
but
could
show
that
none
of
these
characters
of
instinct
are
universal

dose
as
pierre

expresses

instinct
omar
val
frederick
cuvier
and
several
of
the
older
metaphysi
cians
have
compared
instinct
with
habit
this
compar
ison
gives
think
remarkably
accurate
notion
of
the
frame
of
mind
under
which
an
instinctive
action
is
per
formed
but
not
of
its
origin
how
unconsciously
many
habitual
actions
are
performed
indeed
not
rarely
in
direct
opposition
to
our
conscious
will
yet
they
may
be
modi
ﬁes
by
the
will
or
reason
habits
easily
become
associ
ated
with
other
habits
and
with
certain
periods
of
time
and
states
of
the
body
when
once
acquired
they
often
remain
constant
throughout
life
several
other
points
of
resemblance
between
instincts
and
habits
could
be
pointed
out
as
in
repeating
well-known
song
so
in
instinets
one
action
follows
another
by
sort
of
rhythm
if
person
be
interrupted
in
song
or
in
rel;{:eating
anything
by
rote
he
is
generally
forced
to
go
back
to
recover
the
habitual
train
of
thought
so
p
huber
found
it
was
with
cater
eillar
which
makes
very
complicated
hammock
for
if
took
caterpillar
which
had
completed
its
hammock
uglto
say
the
sixth
stage
of
construction
and
put
it
into
hammock
completed
up
only
to
the
third
stage
the
cat
erpillar
simply
re-performed
the
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
stages
of
construction
if
however
caterpillar
were
taken
out
of
hammock
made
up
for
instance
to
the
third
stage
and
were
put
into
one
finished
up
to
the
sixth
stage
so
that
much
of
its
work
was
already
dome
for
it
far
from
feeling
the
benefit
of
this
it
was
much
embar
rassed
and
in
order
to
complete
its
hammock
seemed
forced
to
start
from
the
third
stage
where
it
had
left
off
and
thus
tried
to
complete
the
already
finished
work
if
we
sul;:l}llose
any
habitual
action
to
become
inherited
and
think
it
can
be
shown
that
this
does
sometimes
happen—then
the
resemblance
between
what
originally
was
habit
and
an
instinet
becomes
so
close
as
not
to
be
distinguished
if
mozart
instead
of
playing
the
piano
forte
at
three
years
old
with
wondeﬁlly
little
practice
had
played
tune
with
no
practice
at
all
he
might
traly
be
said
to
have
done
so
instinctively
but
it
would
be
the
most
serious
error
to
suppose
that
the
greater
number
of
instincts
have
been
acquired
by
habit
in
one
generation
cuar
vil
instinot
like
habit
187
and
then
transmitted
by
inheritance
to
succeeding
gene
rations
it
can
be
clearly
shown
that
the
most
wonderful
instincts
with
which
we
are
acquainted
namely
those
of
the
hive-bee
and
of
many
ants
could
not
possibly
have
been
thus
acquired
it
will
be
universally
admitted
that
instincts
are
as
important
as
corporeal
structure
for
the
welfare
of
each
species
under
its
present
conditions
of
life
under
chan
conditions
of
life
it
is
at
least
possible
that
slight
modifi
cations
of
instinet
might
be
profitable
to
species
and
if
it
can
be
shown
that
instincts
do
vary
ever
so
little
then
can
see
no
difficulty
in
natural
selection
preserving
and
continually
accnmulntin§
variations
of
instinct
to
any
extent
that
may
be
profitable
it
is
thus
as
believe
that
all
the
most
complex
and
wonderful
instincts
have
originated
as
modifications
of
corporeal
structure
arise
from
and
are
increased
by
use
or
habit
and
are
dimin
ished
or
lost
by
disuse
80
do
not
doubt
it
has
been
with
instinets
but
believe
that
the
effects
of
habit
are
of
quite
subordinate
importance
to
the
effects
of
the
natu
ral
selection
of
what
may
be
called
accidental
variations
of
instincts
that
is
of
variations
produced
by
the
same
unknown
causes
which
produce
sligﬁt
deviations
of
bodily
structure
no
com})lex
instinet
can
possibly
be
produced
through
natural
selection
except
by
the
slow
and
gradual
accu
mulation
of
numerous
slight
yet
profitable
variations
hence
as
in
the
case
of
corporeal
structures
we
ought
to
find
in
nature
not
the
actual
transitional
gradations
by
which
each
complex
instinet
has
been
acquired—for
these
could
be
found
only
in
the
lineal
ancestors
of
each
species
but
we
ought
to
find
in
the
collateral
lines
of
descent
some
evidence
of
such
gradations
or
we
ought
at
least
to
be
able
to
show
that
gradations
of
some
kiudg
are
possible
and
this
we
certainly
can
do
have
been
surprised
to
find
making
allowance
for
the
instinets
of
animals
havinﬁ
been
but
little
observed
except
in
europe
and
nort
anmerica
and
for
no
instinet
being
known
amongst
extinct
species
how
very
generally
gradations
leading
to
the
most
oompl(ix
instinets
can
be
discovered

changes
of

sometimes
be
facilitated
by
the

having
different

at

periods
of
life

at
different

in

either

and
such
instances
of

of

in

can
be
shown
to
occur
in
nature
again
as
in
the
case
of

and
con
formably
with
my
theory
the
instinct

is
good
for
itself

never

can
judge

of
the
strongest
instances
of
an
animal
apparently
performing
an
action

that
of

removed
all
the
ants
from
group
of
about
dozen
aphides
on
dock-plant
and
pre
vented
their
attendance
during
several
hours
after
this
interval
ifelt
sure
that
the
aphides
would
want
to
excrete
watched
them
for
some
time
through
lens
but
not
one
excreted
then
tickled
and
stroked
them
with
hair
in
the
same
manner
as
well
as
could
as
the
ants
do
with
their
antenns
but
not
one
excreted
afterwards
allowed
an
ant
to
visit
them
and
it
immediately
seemed
by
its
eager
way
of
running
about
to
be
well
aware
what
rich
flock
it
had
discovered
it
then
began
to
play
with
its
antennse
on
the
abdomen
first
of
one
aphis
and
then
of
another
and
each
aphis
as
soon
as
it
felt
the
antenns
immediately
lifted
up
its
abdomen
and
excreted
limpid
drop
of
sweet
juice
which
was
eagerl{
devoured
by
the
ant
even
the
quite
young
aphides
behaved
in
this
man
ner
showing
that
the
action
was
instinctive
and
not
the
result
of
experience
but
as
the
excretion
is
extremely
viscid
it
is
probably
convenience
to
the
aphides
to
have
it
removed
and
therefore
probably
the
aphides
do
not
nstinctively
excrete
for
the
sole
good
of
the
ants
al
though
do
not
believe
that
any
animal
in
the
world
per
forms
an
action
for
the
exclusive
good
of
another
of

189
distinct
species
yet
each
species
tries
to
take
advan
of
the
instincts
of
others
as
each
takes
advantage
of
the
weaker
bodily
structure
of
others
so
again
in
some
few
cases
certain
instincts
cannot
be
considered
as
absolutely
perfect
but
as
details
on
this
and
other
such
points
are
not
indispensable
they
may
be
here
passed
over
as
some
degree
of
variation
in
instincts
under
state
of
nature
and
the
inheritance
of
such
variations
are
in
dispensable
for
the
action
of
natural
selection
as
many

as
possible
ought
to
have
been
here
given
but
want
of
space
prevents
me
can
only
assert
that
in
stincts
certainly
do
vary—for
instance
the
migratory
in
stinet
both
in
extent
and
direction
and
in
its
total
loss
so
it
is
with
the
nests
of
birds
which
vary
partly
in
de
pendence
on
the
situations
chosen
and
on
the
nature
and
temperature
of
the
country
inhabited
but
often
from
causes

audubon

given

of
differences
in

of

in
the
northern
and
southern

fear
of
any
%a.rticula.r

is
certainly
an
instinctive
quality
a8
may
be
seen
in
nestling
birds
though
it
is
strengthened
by
experience
and
by
the
sight
of
fear
of
the
same
enem
in
other
animals
but
fear
of
man
isslowly
acquired
as
have
elsewhere
shown
by
various
animals
inhabiting
desert
islands
and
we
may
see
an
instance
of
this
even
in
england
in
the
greater
wildness
of
all
our
large
birds
than
of
our
small
%)rirds
for
the
large
birds
have
been
most
persecuted
by
man
we
may
safely
attribute
the
greater
wildness
of
our
large
birds
to
this
cause
for
in
uninhabited
islands
large
birds
are
not
more
fearful
than
small
and
the
magpie
so
wary
in

is
tame
in

is

that
the
general
disposition
of

of

is
extremely
diversified
can
be
shown
by
multitude
of
facts
several
cases
also
could
be
given
of
occasional
and
strange
habits
in
certain
species
which

by
briefly
considering
few
cases

shall
thus
also
be
enabled
to
see
the
respective
parts
which
habit
and
the
selection
of
so-called
accidental
va
riations
have
played
in
modifying
the
mental
qualities
of
our
domestic
animals
number
of
curious
and
authen

instances
could
be
given
of
the
inheritance
of
all
shades
of
disposition
and
tastes
and
likewise
of
the
oddest
tricks
associated
with
certain
frames
of
mind
or
periods
of
time
but
let
us
look
to
the
familiar
case
of
the
several
breeds
of
dogs
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
{oung
pointers
i
have
myself
seen
striking
instance
will
sometimes
point
and
even
back
other
dogs
the
very
first
time
that
they
are
taken
out
retrieving
is
certainly
in
some
degree
inherited
by
retrievers
and
tendency
to
run
round
instead
of
at
flock
of
sheep
by
shepherd-dogs
cannotsee
that
these
actions
performed
without
experience
by
the
young
and
in
nearly
the
same
manner
by
each
individual
performed
with
eager
delight
by
each
breed
and
without
the
end
being
known,—for
the
young
pointer
can
no
more
know
that
he
points
to
aid
his
master
than
the
white
butterfly
knows
why
she
lays
her
eggs
on
the
leaf
of
the
cabbage
1
cannot
see
that
these
actions
differ
essentially
from
true
instincts
if
we
were
to
see
one
kind
of
wolf
when
young
and
without
any
training
as
soon
as
it
scented
its
rey
stand
motionless
like
statue
and
then
slowly
crawl

with
peculiar
gait
and
another
kind
of
wolf
rushing
round
instead
of
at
a_herd
of
deer
and
driving
them
to
distant
point
we
should
assuredly
call
these
actions
instinctive
domestic
instincts
as
they
may
be
called
are
certainly
far
less
fixed
or
invariable
than

but
they
have
been
acted
on
by

less
rigorous

and
have
been

for
an
in

shorter
period
under

is
well

when
different
breeds
of

are

thus
it
is
known
that
cross
with

affected
for
many

the

of
greyhounds
and
cross

has

these
domestic
instincts
when
thus
tested
by
crossing
resemble
natural
instincts
which
in
like
manner
become
curiously
blended
together
and
for
long
period
exhibit
traces
of
the
instincts
of
either
parent
for
example
le
roy
describes
dog
whose
great-grandfather
was
wolf
and
this
dog
showed
trace
of
its
wild
parent
only
in
one
way
by
not
coming
in
straight
line
to
his
master
when
called
domestic
instincts
are
sometimes
spoken
of
as
actions
which
have
become
inherited
solely
from
long-continued
and
compulsory
habit
but
this
think
is
not
true
no

woqu
ever
have
thought
of

or
probably
could
have
taught
the
tumbler-pigeon
to
tumble,—an
action
which
as
have
witnessed
is
performed
by
young
birds
that
have
never
seen
pigeon
tumble
may
believe
that
some
one
ig\eon
sgowed
slight
tendency
to
this
strange
habit
and
that
the
long-continued
selection
of
the
best
individuals
in

made
tumblers
what
they
now
are

near

there

it
may
be

whether
any

would
have

of

had
not
some
one

in

and
this
is

occasionally
to
happen
as
once

in

the

probably
as
many
have

only
the

of
an
animal
preparing
to
spring
on

when
the
first
tendency
to

was
once
dis
played
methodical
selection
and
the
inherited
effects
of
compulsory
training
in
each
successive
generation
would
soon
complete
the
work
and
unconscious
selection
is
still
at
work
as
each

tries
to
procure
without

to
improve
the

do
not
suppose
that
domestic

have

that
we
must
attribute
the
whole
of
the

from

sim

and
long-continued

natural
instincts
are
lost
under
domestication
re
markable
instance
of
this
is
seen
in
those
breeds
of
fowls
which
very
rarely
or
never
become

that
is

to
sit

familiarity
alone
pre
vents
our
seeing
how
universally
and
largely
the
minds
of
our
domestic
animals
have
been
modified
by
domestica
tion
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
doubt
that
the
love
of
man
has
become
instinctive
in
the
dog
all
wolves
foxes
jackals
and
species
of
the
cat
genus
when
kept
tame
are
most
eager
to
attack
goultry
sheep
and
pigs
and
this
tendency
has
been
found
incurable
in
dogs
which
have
been
brought
home
as
puppies
from
countries
such
as
tierra
del
fuego
and
australia
where
the
savages
do
not
keep
these
domestic
animals
how
rarely
on
the
other
hand
do
our
civilised
dogs
even
when
quite
young
require
to
be
taught
not
to
attack
é)oultr{
sheep
and
pigs
no
doubt
they
occasionally
do
make
an
attack
and
are
then
beaten
and
if
not
cured
they
are
destroy
ed
so
that
habit
with
some
degree
of
selection
has
prob
ably
concurred
in
civilising
by
inheritance
our
dogs
on
the
other
hand
young
ciic
ens
have
lost
wholly
by
habit
that
fear
oiy
the
dog
and
cat
which
no
doubt
was
originally
instinctive
in
them
in
the
same
way
as
it
is
s0
plainly
instinctive
in
young
pheasants
though
reared
under
hen
it
is
not
that
cﬁickens
have
lost
all
fear
but
fear
only
of
dogs
and
cats
for
if
the
hen
gives
the
danger-chuckle
they
will
run
more
especially
young
tur
keys
from
under
her
and
conceal
themselves
in
the
sur
rounding
grass
or
thickets
and
this
is
evidently
done
for
the
instinctive
purpose
of
allowing
as
we
see
in
wild
ground-birds
their
mother
to
fly
away
but
this
instinct
retained
by
our
chickens
has
become
useless
under
do
mestjcation
for
the
mother-hen
has
almost
lost
by
disuse
the
power
of
flight
ence
we
mt:iy
conclude
that
domestic
instincts
have
been
acquired
and
natural
instincts
have
been
lost
partly
omar
vil
of
the
cuokoo
108
by
habit
and
partly
by
man
selecting
and
aocumnhting
during
successive
ﬁmﬁons
peculiar
mental
habits
an
actions
which
at
first
appeared
from
what
we
must
in
our
ignorance
call
an
accident
in
some
cases
compul
sory
habit
alone
has
sufficed
to
produce
such
inherited
mental
in
other
cases
compulsory
habit
has
done
nothing
and
all
has
been
the
result
of
selection
pursned
both
methodically
and
unconsciously
but
in
most
cases
probably
habit
and
selection
have
acted
together
we
shall
perhaps
best
understand
how
instincts
in
state
of
nature
have
become
modified
by
selection
by
considering
few
cases
will
select
only
three
out
of
the
several
which
shall
have
to
discuss
in
my
future
work,—nameg
the
instinet
which
leads
the
cuckoo
to
lay
her
eggs
in
other
birds
nests
the
slave-making
instinct
of
certain
ants
and
the
comb-making
power
of
the
hive
bee
these
two
latter
instincts
have
gencrally
and
most
justly
been
ranked
by
naturalists
as
the
most
wonderful
of
all
known
instinects
it
is
now
commonly
admitted
that
the
more
immediate
and
final
cause
of
the
cuckoo’s
instinct
is
that
she
lays
her
eggs
not
daily
but
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
days
so
that
if
she
were
to
make
her
own
nest
and
sit
on
her
own
eggs
those
first
laid
would
have
to
be
left
for
some
time
unincubated
or
there
would
be
and
young
birds
of
different
in
the
same
nest
this
were
the
case
the
process
of
laying
and
hatching
might
be
incon
veniently
long
more
especially
as
she
has
to
migrate
at
very
early
period
and
the
first
hatched
young
would
probably
have
to
be
fed
by
the
male
alone
but
the
american
cuckoo
is
in
this
predicament
for
she
makes
her
own
nest
and
has
eggs
and
young
successively
hatched
all
at
the
same
time
1f
has
been
asserted
that
the
ameri
can
cuckoo
occasionally
lays
her
eggs
in
other
birds
nests
but
hear
on
the
high
authority
of
dr
brewer
that
this
is
mistake
nevertheless
could
give
several
instances
of
various
birds
which
have
been
known
occa
ionally
to
lay
their
eggs
in
other
birds
nests
now
let
us
suppose
that
the
ancient.progenitor
of
our
european
cuckoo
had
the
habits
of
the
american
cuckoo
but
that
104
inbtinot
omar
vil
occasionally
she
laid
an
eﬁgin
another
bird’s
nest
if
the
old
bird
profited
by
this
occasional
habit
or
if
the
oung
were
made
more
vigorous
by
advantage
having
{een
taken
of
the
mistaken
maternal
instinct
of
another
bird
than
by
their
own
mother’s
care
encumbered
as
she
can
hardly
fail
to
be
by
having
eggs
and
young
of
dif
ferent
ages
at
the
same
time
then
the
old
birds
or
the
fostered
young
would
gain
an
advantage
and
analogy
would
lead
me
to
believe
that
the
young
thus
reared
would
be
apt
to
follow
by
inheritance
the
occasional
and
aberrant
habit
of
their
mother
and
in
their
turn
would
be
apt
to
lay
their
egis
in
other
birds
nests
and
thus
be
successful
in
rearinglt
eir
youn%
by
continued
process
of
this
nature
believe
that
the
strange
instinet
of
our
cuckoo
could
be
and
has
been
generated
may
add
that
according
to
dr
gray
and
to
some
other
observers
the
european
cuckoo
has
not
utterly
lost
all
maternal
love
and
care
for
her
own
offspring
the
occasional
habit
of
birds
laying
their
eggs
in
other
birds
nests
either
of
the
same
or
of
distinct
species
is
not
very
uncommon
with
the
gallinaces
and
this
per
haps
explains
the
origin
of
sinfular
instinet
in
the
allied
goup
of
ostriches
for
several
hen
ostriches
at
least
in
case
of
the
american
species
unite
and
lay
first
few
eggs
in
one
nest
and
then
in
another
and
these
are
hatched
by
the
males
this
instinct
may
probably
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
of
the
hens
laying
large
number
of
eggs
but
as
in
the
case
of
the
cuckoo
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
days
this
instinct
however
of
the
american
ostrich
has
not
as
yet
been
perfected
for
surprising
number
of
eggs
lie
strewed
over
the
plains
so
that
in
one
day’s
hunting
picked
up
no
less
than
twenty
lost
and
wasted
eggs
many
bees
are
parasitic
and
always
lay
their
eggs
in
the
nests
of
bees
of
other
kinds
this
case
is
more
remark
able
than
that
of
the
cuckoo
for
these
bees
have
not
only
their
instincts
but
their
structure
modified
in
accord
ance
with
their
parasitic
habits
for
they
do
not
possess
the

the

and
its

have
beer
attended
to
by
mr
f
smith
of
the
british
museum
to
whom
am
much
indebted
for
information
on
this
and
other
subjects
although
fully
trusting
to
the
statements
of
huber
and
mr
smitﬁ
tried
to
approach
the
subject
in
sceptical
frame
of
mind
as
any
one
may
well
be
ex
cused
for
doubting
the
truth
of
so
extraordinary
and
odious
an
instinet
as
that
of
making
slaves
hence
will
give
the
observations
which
have
myself
made
in
some
little
detail
opened
fourteen
nests
of
f
sanguinea
and
found
few
slaves
in
all
males
and
fertile
females
of
the
slave-species
are
found
only
in
their
own
proper
commu
nities
and
have
never
been
observed
in
the
nests
of
f
sanguinea
the
slaves
are
black
and
not
above
half
the
size
of
their
red
masters
so
that
the
contrast
in
their
pearance
is
very
great
when
the
nest
is
slightly
dis
turbed
the
slaves
occasionally
come
out
and
iike
their
masters
are
much
agitated
and
defend
the
nest
when
the
nest
is
much
disturbed
and
the
larves
and
pupe
are
ex
posed
the
slaves
work
energetically
with
their
masters
in
carrying
them
away
to
place
of
safety
hence
it
is
clear
that
the
slaves
feel
quite
at
home
during
the
months
of
june
and
july
on
three
successive
years
have
watched
for
many
hours
several
nests
in
surrey
and
sussex
and
never
saw
slave
either
leave
or
enter
nest
as
during
these
months
the
slaves
are
very
few
in
num
ber
thought
that
they
might
behave
differently
when
more
numerous
but
mz
smith
informs
me
that
he
has
watched
the
nests
at
various
hours
during
may
june
and
august
both
in
surrey
and
hampshire
ang
has
never
seen
the
slaves
though
present
in
large
numbers
in
august
either
leave
or
enter
the
nest
hence
he
considers
them
as
strictly
household
slaves
the
masters
on
the
other
hand
may
be
constantly
seen
bringing
in
materials
for
the
nest
and
food
of
all
kinds
during
the
present

however
in
the
month
of

came
across

with
an
unusually
large
stock

this

killed

they
were
prevented
from
getting

then
dug
up

put
them
down
on
bare

near

were

carried

perhaps
fancied
that
after

they

been

to

an

the

with

now
was
curious
to

wh:ger

could

which
they
habitually
make
into

those
of
the
little
and
furious
f

which
they
rarely
capture
and
it
was
evident
that
they
did
at
once
distinguish
them
for
we
have
seen
that
they
eagerly
and
instantly
seized
the
pupe
of
f

whereas
they
were
much
terrified
when
they
came
across
the
i\}pa
or
even
the
earth
from
the
nest
of
f
flava
and
quickly
ran
away
but
in
about
quarter
of
an
hour
shortly
after
all
the
little
yellow
ants
had
crawled
away
they
took
heart
and
carried
off
the
pupse
one
evening
visited
another
community
of
f
san
guines
and
found
number
of
these
ants
entering
their
nest
carrying
the
dead
bodies
of
f
fusca
showing
that
it
was
not
mi
tloni
and
numerous
pups
traced
the
returning
file
burthened
with
booty
for
about
forty
fnrds
to
very
thick
clump
of
heath
whence
saw
the
ast
individual
of
f
sanguinea
emerge
carrying
pups
but
was
not
able
to
find
the
desolated
nest
in
the
thick
heath
the
nest
however
must
have
been
close
at
hand
for
two
or
three
individuals
of
f
fusca
were
about
in
the
greatest
agitation
and
one
was
perched
mo

with
its

in
its
mouth
on
the
top
of

of

an
image
of
despair
over
its

such
are
the
facts
though
they
did
not
need
confir
mation
by
me
in
regard
to
the
wonderful
instinct
of
making
slaves
let
it
be
observed
what
contrast
the
instinetive
habits
of
f
sanguinea
present
with
those
of
the
continental
f
tufescens
the
latter
does
not
build
its
own
nest
does
not
determine
its
own
migrations
does
not
collect
food
for
itself
or
its
young
and
cannot
even
feed
itself
it
is
absolutely
dependent
on
its
numer
ous
slaves
formica
sanguinea
on
the
other
hand
possesses
much
fewer
slaves
and
in
the
early
part
of
the
summer
extremely
few
the
masters
determine
when
and
where
new
nest
shall
be
formed
and
when
they
migrate
the
masters
carry
the
slaves
both
in
switzerland
and
england
the
slaves
seem
to
have
the
exclusive
care
of
the
larves
and
the
masters
alone
go
on
slave-making
expeditions
in
switzerland

it
may
be
called

and
thus
both

for

england
the
masters
alone
usually
leave
the
nest
to
collect
building
materials
and
food
for
themselves
their
slaves
and
larvee
so
that
the
masters
in
this
country
receive
much
less
service
from
their
slaves
than
they
do
in
switzerland
by
what
steps
the
instinct
of
f
sanguinea
originated
will
not
pretend
to
conjecture
but
as
ants
which
are
not
slave-makers
will
as
have
seen
carry
off
pups
of
other
species
if
scattered
near
their
nests
it
is
possible
that
pupse
originally
stored
as
food
might
become
devel
oped
and
the
ants
thus
unintentionally
reared
would
en
follow
their
proper
instincts
and
do
what
work
the
could
if
their
presence
proved
useful
to
the
species
whici
had
seized
them—if
it
were
more
advantageous
to
this
species
to
capture
workers
than
to
procreate
them—the
habit
of
collecting
pupse
originally
for
food
might
by
natural
selection
be
strengthened
and
rendered
permanent
for
the
very
different
purpose
of
raising
slaves
when
the
instinct
was
once
acquired
if
carried
out
to
much
less
extent
even
than
in
our
british
f
sanguinea
which
a8
we
have
seen
is
less
aided
by
its
slaves
than
the
same
species
in
switzerland
can
see
no
difficulty
in
natural
selection
increasing
and
modifiing
the
instinct—always
supposing
each
modification
to
be
of
use
to
the
species
until
an
ant
was
formed
as
abjectly
dependent
on
its
slaves
as
is
the
formica
rufescens
ing
instinct
of
the
hive-bee.—i
will
not
here
enter
on
minute
details
on
this
subject
but
will
merel
ive
an
outline
of
the
conclusions
at
which
have
arrived
must
be
dull
man
who
can
examine
the
exquisite
structure
of
comb
so
beautifully
adapted
to
its
end
without
enthusiastic
admiration
%ve
hear
from
mathe
maticians
that
bees
have
ﬂfmctically
solved
recondite
problem
and
have
made
their
cells
of
the
proper
shaﬁe
to
hold
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
honey
with
the
least
possible
consumption
of
precious
wax
in
their
con
struction
it
has
been
remarked
that
skilful
workman
200
inbtinoct
omar
vii
with
fitting
tools
and
measures
would
find
it
very
diffi
cult
to
make
cells
of
wax
of
the
true
form
though
this
is
eerfectl&
effected
by
crowd
of
bees
working
mn
dark
ive
grant
whatever
instincts
you
please
and
it
seems
at
first
quite
inconceivable
how
they
can
make
all
the
necessary
angles
and
planes
or
even
f)erceive
when
they
are
correctly
made
but
the
difficulty
is
not
nearly
so
eat
as
it
at
first
appears
all
this
beautiful
work
can
ﬁ
shown
think
to
follow
from
few
very
simple
in
stincts
was
led
to
investigate
this
subject
by
mr
water
house
who
has
shown
that
the
form
of
the
cell
stands
in
close
relation
to
the
presence
of
adjoining
cells
and
the
following
view
may
perhaps
be
considered
only
as
modification
of
his
theory
us
look
to
the
great
prin
ciple
of
gradation
and
see
whether
nature
does
not
re
veal
to
us
her
method
of
work
at
one
end
of
short
series
we
have
humble-bees
which
use
their
old
cocoons
to
hold
honey
sometimes
adding
to
them
short
tubes
of
wax
and
likewise
making
separate
and
very
irregular
rounded
cells
of
wax
at
the
other
end
of
the
series
we
have
the
cells
of
the
hive-bee
placed
in
double
layer
each
cell
as
is
well
known
is
an
hexagonal
prism
with
the
basal
edges
of
its
six
sides
bevelled
so
as
to
join
on
to
pyramid
formed
of
three
rhombs
these
rhombs
have
certain
angles
and
the
three
which
form
the
pyramidal
base
of
single
cell
on
one
side
of
the
comb
enter
into
the
composition
of
the
bases
of
three
adjoining
cells
on
the
opposite
side
in
the
series
between
the
extreme
perfec
tion
of
the
cells
of
the
hive-bee
and
the
simplicity
of
those
of
the
humble-bee
we
have
the
cells
of
the
mexican
me
lipona
domestica
carefully
described
and
figured
by
pierre
huber
the
melipona
itself
is
intermediate
in
structure
between
the
hive
and
humble
bee
but
more
nearly
related
to
the
latter
it
forms
nearly
regular
waxen
comb
of
cylindrical
cells
in
which
the
young
are
hatched
and
in
addition
some
large
cells
of
wax
for
holding
honey
these
latter
cells
are
nearly
spherical
and
of
nearly
equal
sizes
and
are
aggregated
into
an
ir
regular
mass
but
the
important
point
to
notice
is
that
cmr
vil
cells
of
the
hive-bee
201
these
cells
are
always
made
at
that
degree
of
nearness
to
each
other
that
they
would
have
intersected
or
broken
into
each
other
if
the
spheres
had
been
completed
but
this
is
never
permitted
the
bees
building
perfectly
flat
walls
of
wax
between
the
spheres
which
thus
tend
to
in
tersect
hence
each
cell
consists
of
an
outer
spherical
portion
and
of
two
three
or
more
perfectly
flat
surfaces
according
as
the
cell
adjoins
two
three
or
more
other
cells
hen
one
cell
comes
into
contact
with
three
other
cells
which
from
the
spheres
being
nearly
of
the
same
size
is
very
frequently
and
nec
ily
the
case
the
three
flat
surfaces
are
united
into
pyramid
and
this
pyramid
as
huber
has
remarked
is
manifestly
gross
imitation
of
the
three-sided
pyramidal
basis
of
the
cell
of
the
hive-bee
asin
the
cells
of
the
hive-bee
so
here
the
three
plane
surfaces
in
any
one
cell
necessarily
enter
into
the
con
struction
of
three
adjoining
cells
it
is
obvious
that
the
melipona
gaves
wax
by
this
manner
of
building
for
the
flat
walls
between
the
adjoining
cells
are
not
double
but
are
of
the
same
thickness
as
the
outer
spherical
llportioms
and
i{et
each
flat
sgrtion
forms
part
of
two
cells
eflecting
on
this
case
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
the
melipona
had
made
its
spheres
at
some
given
distance
from
each
other
and
had
made
them
of
equal
sizes
and
had
arranged
them
symmetrically
in
double
layer
the
resulting
structure
would
probably
have
been
as
perfect
as
the
comb
of
the
hive-bee
accordingly
wrote
to
professor
miller
of
cambridge
and
this
geometer
has
kindly
read
over
the
following
statement
drawn
up
from
his
information
and
tells
me
that
it
is
strictly
correct
if
number
of
equal
spheres
be
described
with
their
centres
placed
in
two
pnaﬁel
layers
with
the
centre
of
each
sphere
at
the
distance
of
radius
2
or
radius
141421
or
at
some
lesser
distance
from
the
centres
of
the
six
surrounding
spheres
in
the
same
layer
and
at
the
same
distance
from
the
centres
of
the
nd_{oming
spheres
in
the
other
and
parallel
layer
then
if
planes
of
intersec
tion
between
the
several
spheres
in
both
layers
be
formed
there
will
result

with
the
best
measurements
which
have
been
made
of
the
cells
of
the
hive-bee
hence
we
may
safely
conclude
that
if
we
could
slightly
modify
the
instincts
already
possessed
by
the
melipona
and
in
themselves
not
very
wonderful
this
bee
would
make
structure
as
wonderfully
perfect
as
that
of
the
hive-bee
we
must
suppose
the
melipona
to
make
her
cells
truly
spherical
and
of
equal
sizes
and
this
would
not
be
very
surprising
seein
e%hat
she
already
does
80
to
certain
extent
and
seeing
what
perfectly
cylindri
cal
burrows
in
wood
many
insects
can
make
apparently
by
turning
round
on
fixed
point
we
must
suppose
the
elipona
to
arrange
her
cells
in
level
layers
as
she
al
ready
does
her
cylindrical
cells
and
we
must
further
suppose
and
this
is
the
greatest
difficulty
that
she
can
somehow
judge
accurately
at
what
distance
to
stand
from
her
fellow-labourers
when
several
are
making
their
spheres
but
she
is
already
so
far
enabled
to
judge
of
dis
tance
that
she
always
describes
her
spheres
so
as
to
in
tersect
largely
and
then
she
unites
the
points
of
intersec
tion
by
perfectly
flat
surfaces
we
have
further
to
sup
o0se
but
this
is
no
difficulty
that
after
hexagonal
prisms
ave
been
formed
by
the
intersection
of
adjoining
spheres
in
the
same
layer
she
can
prolong
the
hexagon
to
any
length
requisite
to
hold
the
stock
of
honey
in
the
same
way
as
the
rude
humble-bee
adds
cylinders
of
wax
to
the
circular
mouths
of
her
old
cocoons
by
such
modifica
tions
of
instincts
in
themselves
not
very
wonderful,—hard
ly
more
wonderful
than
those
which
guide
bird
to
make
its
nest,—i
believe
that
the
hive-bee
has
acquired
through
natural
selection
her
inimitable
architectural
powers
but
this
theory
can
be
tested
by
experiment
follow
ing
the
example
of
mr
tegetmeier
separated
two
combs
and
put
between
them
long
thick
square
strip
of
wax
the
bees
instantly
began
to
excavate
minute
cir
cular
pits
in
it
and
as
they
deepened
these
little
pits
they
made
them
wider
and
wider
until
they
were
convert
ed
mnto
shallow
basins
appearing
to
the
eye
perfectly
true
cuar
vil
cells
of
the
hive-bee
203
or
parts
of
sphere
and
of
about
the
diameter
of
cell
it
was
most
interesting
to
me
to
observe
that
wherever
several
bees
had
begun
to
excavate
these
basins
near
to
gether
they
had
begun
their
work
at
such
distance
from
each
other
that
bg
the
time
the
basins
had
acquired
the
above
stated
width
2
e
about
the
width
of
an
ordinary
celtl}l
and
were
in
depth
about
one
sixth
of
the
diameter
of
the
sphere
of
which
they
formed
part
the
rims
of
the
basins
intersected
or
broke
into
each
other
as
soon
as
this
occurred
the
bees
ceased
to
excavate
and
began
to
build
up
flat
walls
of
wax
on
the
lines
of
intersection
be
tween
the
basins
so
that
each
hexaﬁonal
prism
was
built
upon
the
festooned
edge
of
smooth
basin
instead
of
on
the
straight
edfes
of
three-sided
pyramid
as
in
the
case
of
ordinary
cells
then
put
into
the
hive
instead
of
thick
square
piece
of
wax
thin
and
narrow
knife-edged
ridge
col
oured
with
vermillion
the
bees
instantly
began
on
both
sides
to
excavate
little
basins
near
to
each
other
in
the
same
way
as
before
but
the
ridge
of
wax
was
so
thin
that
the
bottoms
of
the
basins
if
they
had
been
excavated
to
the
same
depth
as
in
the
former
experiment
would
have
broken
into
each
other
from
the
opposite
sides
the
bees
however
did
not
suffer
this
to
happen
and
they
stopped
their
excavations
in
due
time
so
that
the
basins
as
soon
as
they
had
been
little
deepened
came
to
have
flat
bottoms
and
these
flat
bottoms
formed
by
thin
little
plates
of
the
vermillion
wax
having
been
left
ungnawed
were
situated
as
far
as
the
eye
could
judge
exactly
along
the
planes
of
imaginary
intersection
between
the
basins
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
ridge
of
wax
in
parts
only
little
eits
in
other
parts
large
portions
of
rhombic
plate
had
been
left
between
the
opposed
basins
but
the
work
from
the
unnatural
state
of
t}l)lings
had
not
been
neatly
performed
the
bees
must
have
worked
at
very
nearl
the
same
rate
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
ridge
of
vermil
lion
wax
as
they
circularly
gnawed
away
and
deepened
the
basins
on
both
sides
in
order
to
have
succeeded
in
thus
leaving
flat
plates
between
the
basins
by
stopping
work
along
the

instinct
cmar
vil
considering
how
flexible
thin
wax
is
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
difficulty
in
the
bees
whilst
at
work
on
the
two
sides
of
strip
of
wax
perceivin%]when
they
have
gnawed
the
wax
away
to
the
proper
thinness
then
stopping
their
work
in
ordinary
combs
it
has
appeared
to
me
teat
the
bees
do
not
always
succeed
in
working
at
exactly
the
same
rate
from
the
opposite
sides
for
have
noticed
half-completed
rhombs
at
the
base
of
just-com
menced
cell
which
were
slightly
concave
on
one
side
where
suppose
that
the
bees
had
excavated
too
quickly
and
convex
on
the
ﬁposed
side
where
the
bees
had
worked
less
quickly
one
well-marked
instance
put
the
comb
back
into
the
hive
and
allowed
the
bees
to
go
on
working
for
short
time
and
again
examined
the
cell
and
found
that
the
rhombic
plate
had
been
completed
and
had
become
perfectly
flat
it
was
absolutely
impossi
ble
from
the
extreme
thinness
of
the
little
rhombic
plate
that
they
could
have
effected
this
by
gnawing
away
the
convex
side
and
suspect
that
the
bees
in
such
cases
stand
in
the
opposed
cells
and
push
and
bend
the
ductile
and
warm
wax
which
as
have
tried
is
easily
done
into
its
proper
intermediate
plane
and
thus
flatten
it
rom
the
experiment
of
the
ridge
of
vermilion
wax
we
can
clearly
see
that
if
the
bees
were
to
build
for
them
selves
thin
wall
of
wax
they
could
make
their
cells
of
the
pro%er
shape
by
standing
at
the
proper
distance
from
each
other
by
excavating
at
the
same
rate
and
by
en
deavouring
to
make
equal
spherical
hollows
but
never
allowing
the
spheres
to
break
into
each
other
now
bees
as
may
be
clearly
seen
by
examining
the
edge
of
growing
comb
do
make
rough
circumferential
wall
or
rim
all
round
the
comb
and
they
gnaw
into
this
from
the
opposite
sides
always
working
circularly
as
they
deepen
each
cell
they
do
not
make
the
whole
three—siged
pyra
midal
bage
of
any
one
cell
at
the
same
time
but
only
the
one
rhombic
plate
which
stands
on
the
extreme
growing
margin
or
the
two
plates
as
the
case
may
be
and
they
never
com
elete
the
upper
edges
of
the
rhombic
plates
until
the
exagonal
walls
are
commenced
some
of
these
statements
differ
from
those
made
by
the
justly
celebrated
elder
huber
caur
vil
cells
of
the
hivebee
205
but
am
convineed
of
their
accuracy
and
if
had
space
could
show
that
they
are
conformable
with
my
theory
huber’s
statement
that
the
very
first
cell
is
excavated
out
of
little
parallel-sided
wall
of
wax
is
not
as
far
as
have
seen
strictly
correct
the
first
commencement
hav
ing
always
been
little
hood
of
wax
but
will
not
here
enter
on
these
details
we
see
how
important
part
ex
cavation
plays
in
the
construction
of
the
cells
but
it
would
be
great
error
to
suppose
that
the
bees
cannot
build
up
rou%h
wall
of
wax
in
the
proper
position—that
is
along
the
plane
of
intersection
between
two
adjoining
eheres
have
several
specimens
showing
clearly
that
ey
can
do
this
even
in
the
rude
circumferential
rim
or
wall
of
wax
round
growing
comb
flexures
may
some
times
be
observed
corresponding
in
position
to
the
planes
of
the
rhombic
basal
plates
of
future
cells
but
the
rough
wall
of
wax
has
in
every
case
to
be
finished
off
by
being
largely
gnawed
away
on
both
sides
the
manner
in
which
the
bees
build
is
curious
they
always-make
the
first
rough
wall
from
ten
to
twenty
times
thicker
than
the
excessively
thin
finished
wall
of
the
cell
which
will
ultimately
be
left
we
shall
understand
how
they
work
by
supposing
masons
first
to
pile
up
broad
ridge
of
cement
and
then
to
begin
cutting
it
away
equally
on
both
sides
near
the
ground
till
smooth
very
thin
wall
is
left
in
the
middle
the
masons
always
piling
up
the
cut-away
cement
and
adding
fresh
cement
on
the
summit
of
the
ridge
we
ghall
thus
have
thin
wall
steadily
growing
upward
but
always
crowned
by
gigantic
coping
from
all
the
cells
both
those
just
commenced
and
those
com
pleted
being
thus
crowned
by
strong
coping
of
wax
the
bees
can
cluster
and
crawl
over
the
comb
without
in
iuring
the
delicate
hexagonal
walls
which
are
only
about
one
four-hundreth
of
an'inch
in
thickness
the
plates
of
the
pyramidal
basis
being
about
twice
as
thick
by
this
singular
manner
of
building
strength
is
continually
given
to
the
comb
with
the
utmost
ultimate
economy
of
wax
it
seems
at
first
to
add
to
the
difficulty
of
understand
ing
how
the
cells
are
made
that
a
multitude
of
bees
all
work
together
one
bee
after
working
short
time
at
one
208
inbtinct
cmar
vil
cell
going
to
another
so
that
as
huber
has
stated
score
of
individuals
work
even
at
the
commencement
of
the
first
cell
was
able
eracticnl]y
to
show
this
fact
by
covering
the
edges
of
the
hexagonal
walls
of
single
cell
or
the
extreme
margin
of
the
circumferential
rim
of
growing
comb
with
an
extremely
thin
layer
of
melted
vermilion
wax
and
invariably
found
that
the
colour
was
most
delicately
diffused
by
the
bees—as
delicately
as
painter
could
have
done
with
his
brush—by
atoms
of
the
coloured
wax
having
been
taken
from
the
spot
on
which
it
had
been
placed
and
worked
into
the
growing
edges
of
the
cells
all
round
the
work
of
construction
seems
to
be
sort
of
balance
struck
between
many
bees
all
instinctively
standing
at
the
same
relative
distance
from
each
other
trying
to
sweep
egual
spheres
and
then
building
up
or
leaving
ungnawed
the
planes
of
intersection
between
these
spheres
it
was
really
curious
to
note
in
cases
of
difficulty
as
when
two
pieces
of
comb
met
at
an
angle
how
often-the
bees
wouﬁi
entirely
pull
down
and
rebuild
in
different
ways
the
same
cell
sometimes
recurring
to
shape
which
they
had
at
first
rejected
en
bees
have
place
on
which
they
can
stand
in
their
proper
positions
for
working—for
instance
on
slig
of
wood
placed
directly
under
the
middle
of
com
growing
downwards
so
that
the
comb
has
to
be
built
over
one
face
of
the
slip—in
this
case
the
bees
can
lay
the
foundations
of
one
wall
of
new
hexagon
in
its
strictly
froper
place
projecting
beyond
the
other
completed
cells
suffices
that
the
bees
should
be
enabled
to
stand
at
their
proper
relative
distances
from
each
other
and
from
the
walls
of
the
last
completed
cells
and
then
by
striking
imaginary
spheres
they
can
build
up
wall
intermediate
between
two
adjoining
spheres
but
as
far
as
have
seen
they
never
gnaw
away
and
finish
off
the
angles
of
cell
till
large
part
both
of
that
cell
and
of
the
adjoining
cells
has
been
built
this
capacity
in
bees
of
laying
down
under
certain
circumstances
rough
wall
in
its
proper
place
between
two
just-commenced
cells
is
important
as
1t
bears
on
fact
which
seems
at
first
qunite
subversive
of
the
foregoing
theory
namely
that
the
cells
on
the
ex
cuar
vil
oells
of
the
hive-bee
207
tremc
margin
of
wasp-combs
are
sometimes
strictly
hex
agonal
but
have
not
space
here
to
enter
on
this
sub
ject
nor
does
there
seem
to
me
any
great
difficulty
in
single
insect
as
in
the
case
of
queen-wasp
makin
hexagonal
cells
if
she
work
alternately
on
the
inside
an
outside
of
two
or
three
cells
commenced
at
the
same
time
always
standing
at
the
proper
relative
distance
from
the
parts
of
the
cells
just
begun
sweeping
spheres
or
cyl
inders
and
building
up
intermediate
planes
it
is
even
conceivable
that
an
insect
might
by
fixing
on
point
at
which
to-commence
cell
and
then
moving
outside
first
to
one
point
and
then
to
five
other
points
at
the
proper
relative
distances
from
the
central
point
and
from
each
other
strike
the
planes
of
intersection
and
so
make
an
isolated
hexagon
but
am
not
aware
that
any
such
case
has
been
observed
nor
would
any
good
be
derived
from
single
hexagon
being
built
as
in
its
construction
more
materials
would
be
required
than
for
cylinder
as
natural
selection
acts
only
by
the
accumulation
of
slight
modifications
of
structure
or
instinct
each
profit
able
to
the
individual
under
its
conditions
of
life
it
may
reasonably
be
asked
how
long
and
graduated
succession
of
modified
architectural
instincts
all
tending
towards
the
present
perfect
plan
of
construction
could
have
profited
the
progenitors
of
the
hive-bee
think
the
answer
is
not
difficult
it
is
known
that
bees
are
often
hard
pressed
to
get
sufficient
nectar
and
am
informed
by
mr
tegetmeler
that
it
has
been
experimentally
found
that
no
less
than
from
twelve
to
fifteen
pounds
of
dry
sugar
are
consumed
by
hive
of
bees
for
the
secretion
of
each
pound
of
wax
so
that
prodigious
quantity
of
fluid
nectar
must
be
collected
and
consumed
by
the
bees
in
hive
for
the
secretion
of
the
wax
necessary
for
the
con
struction
of
their
combs
moreover
many
bees
have
to
remain
idle
for
many
days
during
the
process
of
secretion
large
store
of
honey
is
indispensable
to
support
lane
stock
of
bees
during
the
winter
and
the
security
of
the
hive
is
known
mainly
to
depend
on
large
number
of
bees
being
supported
hence
the
saving
of
wax
by
largely
saving
honey
must
be
most
important
element
208
instinct
omar
vil
of
success
in
any
family
of
bees
of
course
the
success
ofany
species
of
beo
may
be
dependent
on
the
number
of
its
para
sites
or
other
enemies
or
on
quite
distinct
causes
and
so
be
altogether
independent
of
the
quantity
of
honey
which
the
bees
could
collect
but
let
us
suppose
that
this
latter
cir
cumstance
determined
as
it
probably
often
does
determine
the
numbers
ofa
humble-bee
which
could
existin
country
but
jet
us
suppose
differently
to
what
really
is
the
case
that
the
community
lived
throughout
the
winter
and
conse
quently
required
store
of
ﬁoney
there
can
in
this
case
be
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
our
humble
bee
if
slight
modification
of
her
instinct
led
her
to
make
her
wazxen
cells
near
together
so
as
to
intersect
little
for
wall
in
common
even
to
two
adjoining
cells
would
save
some
little
wax
hence
it
would
continually
be
more
and
more
advantageous
to
our
humble-bee
if
she
were
to
make
her
cells
more
and
more
regular
nearer
together
and
aggregated
into
mass
like
the
cells
of
the
melipona
for
in
this
case
large
part
of
the
boundin
surface
of
each
cell
would
serve
to
l?ound
other
cells
much
wax
would
be
saved
again
from
the
same
cause
it
would
be
advantageous
to
the
melipona
if
she
were
to
make
her
cells
closer
together
and
more
regular
in
every
wa{
than
at
present
for
then
as
we
have
seen
the
spher
ical
surfaces
would
wholly
disn}})ear
and
would
all
be
replaced
by
plane
surfaces
and
the
melipona
would
make
comb
as
perfect
as
that
of
the
hive-bee
beyond
this
stage
of
perfection
in
architecture
natural
selection
could
not
leadp
for
the
comb
of
the
hive-bee
as
far
as
we

thus
as

of

that
of

be
explained
by
natural

having
taken
advantage
of
numerous

modifications
of

natural

having
by

of

could
be

cases
in

cases
of

of

such
trifling
importance
that
they
could
hardly
have
been
acted
on
by
natural

cases
of
instincts
almost
identically
the

in
animals
so
remote
in
the
scale
of
nature
that
we
cannot
account
for
their
similarity
by
inheritance
from
common
parent
and
must
therefore
believe
that
they
have
been
acquired
by
independent
acts
of
natural
selection
will
not
here
enter
on
these
several
cases
but
will
confine
myself
to
one
special
diﬁ‘icult{
which
at
first
appeared
to
me
insuperable
and
actually
fatal
to
my
whole
theory
allude
to
the
neuters
or
ster
ile
females
in
insect
communities
for
these
neuters
often
differ
widely
in
instinct
and
in
structure
from
both
the
males
and
fertile
females
and
yet
from
being
sterile
they
cannot
progagate
their
kind
the
subject
well
deserves
to
be
discussed
at
great
lcni:‘h
but
will
here
take
only
single
case
that
of
working
or
sterile
ants
how
the
workers
have
been
ren
dered
sterile
is
difficulty
but
not
much
greater
than
that
of
any
other
striking
modification
of
structure
for
it
can
be
shown
that
some
insects
and
other
articulate
animals
in
state
of
nature
occasionally
become
sterile
and
if
such
insects
had
been
social
and
it
had
been
profit
able
to
the
community
that
number
should
have
been
annually
born
capable
of
work
but
incapable
of
procrea
tion
can
see
no
very
great
difficulty
in
this
bein'gl:ﬁ‘ecb
ed
by
natural
eelection
but
must
pass
over
this
pre
210
instinot
crar
vil
liminary
difficulty
the
great
difficulty
lies
in
the
working
ants
differing
widely
from
both
the
males
and
the
fertile
females
in
structure
as
in
the
shape
of
the
thorax
and
in
being
destitute
of
wings
and
sometimes
of
eyes
and
in
instinet
as
far
as
instinct
alone
is
concerned
the
prodi
ious
difference
in
this
respect
between
the
workers
and
%he
erfect
females
would
have
been
far
better
exempli
ﬁed%
the
hive-bee
if
working
ant
or
other
neuter
insect{md
becn
an
animal
in
the
ordinary
state
should
have
unhesitatingly
assumed
that
all
its
characters
had
been
slowly
acquired
through
natural
selection
namely
by
an
individual
having
been
%orn
with
some
slight
profitable
modification
of
structure
this
being
inherited
by
its
off
spring
which
again
varied
and
were
again
selected
and
go
onwards
but
with
the
working
ant
we
have
an
insect
differing
greaﬂg
from
its
parents
yet
absolutely
sterile
so
that
it
could
never
have
transmitted
successively
ac
uired
modifications
of
structure
or
instinet
to
its
progeny
%t
may
well
be
asked
how
is
it
possible
to
reconcile
this
case
with
the
theory
of
natural
selection
first
let
it
be
remembered
that
we
have
innumerable
instances
both
in
our
domestic
productions
and
in
those
in
state
of
nature
of
all
sorts
of
differences
of
structure
which
have
become
correlated
to
certain
ages
and
to
either
sex
we
have
differences
correlated
not
only
to
one
sex
but
to
that
short
period
alone
when
the
repro
ductive
system
is
active
as
in
the
nuptial
plumaigc
of
many
birds
and
in
the
hooked
jaws
of
the
male
salmon
we
have
even
slight
differences
in
the
horns
of
different
breeds
of
caitlein
relation
to
an
artificially
imperfect
state
of
the
male
sex
for
oxen
of
certain
breeds
have
longer
horns
than
in
other
breeds
in
comparison
with
the
horns
of
the
bulls
or
cows
of
these
same
breeds
hence
can
see
no
real
difficulty
in
any
character
having
become
correlated
with
the
sterile
condition
of
certain
members
of
insect
communities
the
difficulty
lies
in
understanding
how
such
correlated
modifications
of
structure
could
have
been
slowly
accumulated
by
natural
selection
this
difficulty
though
appearing
insuperable
is
les
sened
or
as
believe
disappears
when
it
is
remembered
cuir

that
selection
may
be
applied
to
the
family
as
well
asto
the
individual
and
may
thus
gain
the
desired
end
thus
well-flavored
vegetable
is
cooked
and
the
individual
is
destreyed
but
the
horticulturist
sows
seeds
of
the
same
stock
and
confidently
expects
to
get
nearly
the
same
variety
breeders
of
cattle
wish
the
flesh
and

to
be
well-marbled
together
the
animal
has
been
slaughtered
but
the
breeder
goes
with
confidence
to
the

have
such
faith
in
the
powers
of
selection
that
do
not
doubt
that
breed
of
cattle
always
yielding
oxen
with

long
horns
could
be
slowly
formed
by
carefully
watching
which
individual

and
cows
when
matched
produced
oxen
with
the
longest
horns
and
yet
no
one

could
ever
have
propagated
its

thus
believe
it

the

of

the

and

of
the

community
flourished
and
trasmitted
to
their
fertile
offspring
tendency
to
produce
sterile
members
having
the
same
modification
and
believe
that
this
process
has
been
repeated
until
that
prodigious
amount
of
difference
between
the
fertile
and
sterile
females
of
the
same
species
has
been
produced
which
we
see
in
many
social
insects
but
we
have
not
as
yet
touched
on
the
climax
of
the
diffi
culty
namely
the
fact
that
the
neuters
of
several
ants
differ
not
only
from
the
fertile
females
and
males
but
from
each
other
sometimes
to
an
almost
incredible
degrce
and
are
thus
divided
into
two
or
even
three
castes
the
castes
moreover
do
not
ﬁgenemlly
graduate
into
each
other
but
are
perfectly
well
defined
being
as
distinct
from
each
other
as
are
any
two
species
of
the
same
genus
or
rather
as
any
two
genera
of
the
same
family
us
in
eciton
there
are
working
and
soldier
neuters
with
jaws
and
instincts
ex
traordinarily
different
in
cryptocerus
the
workers
of
one
caste
alone
carry
wonderful
sort
of
shield
on
their
heads
the
use
of
which
is
quite
unknown
in
the
mexican
myrmecocystus
the
workers
of
one
caste
never
leave
the
nest
they
are
fed
by
the
workers
of
another
caste
and

as
they
may
be
called
which
our
european
ants
guard
or
imprison
it
will
indeed
be
thought
that
have
an
overwecning
confidence
in
the
principle
of
natural
selection
when
do
not
admit
that
such
wonderful
and
well-established
facts
at
once
annijhilate
my
theory
in
the
simpler
case
of
neuter
insects
all
of
one
caste
or
of
the
same
kind
which
have
been
rendered
by
natural
selection
as
believe
to
be
quite
possible
different
from
the
fertile
males
and
females,—in
this
case
we
may
safely
conclude
from
the
analogy
of
ordinary
variations
that
each
successive
slight
profitable
modification
did
not
probably
at
first
appear
in
all
the
individual
neuters
in
the
same
nest
but
in
few
alone
and
that
by
the
long-continued
selection
of
the
fertile
parents
which
produced
most
neuters
with
the
profitable
modification
all
the
neuters
ultimately
came
to
have
the
desired
character
on
this
view
we
ought
occasionally
to
find
neuter-insects
of
the
same
species
in
the
same
nest
presenting
gradations
of
structure
and
this
we
do
find
even
often
considering
how
few
neuter-insects
out
of
europe
have
been
carefully
examined
mr
f
smith
has
shown
how
surprisingly
the
neuters
of
several
british
ants
differ
from
each
other
in
size
and
sometimes
in
colour
and
that
the
extreme
forms
can
sometimes
be
perfectly
linked
together
by
individuals
taken
out
of
the
same
nest
have
myself
compared
perfect
gradations
of
this
kind
it
often
happens
that
the
larger
or
the
smaller
sized
workers
are
the
most
numerous
or
that
both
large
and
small
are
numerous
with
those
of
an
intermediate
size
scanty
in
numbers
formica
flava
has
larger
and
smaller
workers
with
some
of
intermediate
size
and
in
this
species
as
mr
f
smith
has
observed
the
larger
workers
have
simple
eges
ocelli
which
though
small
can
be
plainly
distinguished
whereas
the
smaller
workers
have
tﬁeir
ocelli
rudimentary
having
carefully
dissected
several
specimens
of
these
workers
can
affirm
that
the
eyes
are
far
more
rudimentary
in
the
smaller
workers
than
can
be
accounted
for
merely
by
their
pro
omr
vi
neuter
1nbects
918
portionally
lesser
size
and
fully
believe
though
dare
not
assert
so
positively
that
the
workers
of
intermediate
size
have
their
ocelli
in
an
exactly
intermediate
condition
so
that
we
here
have
two
bodies
of
sterile
workers
in
the
same
nest
differing
not
only
in
size
but
in
their
organs
of
vision
yet
connected
by
some
few
members
in
an
intermediate
condition
may
digress
by
adding
that
if
the
smaller
workers
had
been
the
most
useful
to
the
com
munity
and
those
males
and
females
had
been
continually
selected
which
produced
more
and
more
of
the
smaller
workers
until
all
the
workers
had
come
to
be
in
this
con
dition
we
should
then
have
had
species
of
ant
with
neuters
very
nearly
in
the
same
condition
with
those
of
myrmica
for
the
workers
of
myrmica
have
not
even
rudiments
of
ocelli
though
the
male
and
female
ants
of
this
genus
have
well-developed
ocelli
may
give
one
other
case
so
confidently
did
expect
to
find
aﬁlations
in
important
points
of
structure
between
the
different
castes
of
neuters
in
the
same
species
that
gladly
availed
myself
of
mr
f
smith’s
offer
of
numerous
specimens
from
the
same
nest
of
the
driver
ant
anomma
of
west
africa
the
reader
will
perhaps
best
appreciate
the
amount
of
difference
in
these
workers
by
my
giving
not
the
actual
measurements
but
strictly
accurate
illus
tration
the
difference
was
the
same
as
if
we
were
to
see
set
of
workmen
building
house
of
whom
many
were
five
feet
four
inches
high
and
many
sixteen
feet
high
but
we
must
suppose
that
the
larger
workmen
had
heads
four
instead
of
three
times
as
big
as
those
of
the
smaller
men
and
jaws
nearly
five
times
as
big
the
jaws
more
over
of
the
working
ants
of
the
several
sizes
differ
wonderfully
in
shape
and
in
the
form
and
number
of
the
teeth
but
the
important
fact
for
us
is
that
though
the
workers
can
be
grouped
into
castes
of
different
sizes
yet
they
graduate
insensibly
into
each
other
as
does
the
widely
different
structure
of
their
jaws
speak
confidently
on
this
latter
point
as
mr
lubbock
made
drawings
for
me
with
the
camera
lucida
of
the
jaws
which
had
dissected
from
the
workers
of
the
several
sizes
with
these
facts
before
me
believe
that
natural
se
214
instinct
cmar
vil
lection
by
acting
on
the
fertile
pareuts
could
form
spe
cies
which
should
regularly
produce
neuters
either
all
of
large
size
with
one
form
of
jaw
or
all
of
small
size
with
jaws
having
widely
different
structure
or
lastly
and
this
is
our
climax
of
difficulty
one
set
of
workers
of
one
size
and
structure
and
simultaneously
another
set
of
workers
of
different
size
and
structure
a
graduated
series
having
been
first
formed
as
in
the
case
of
the
driver
ant
and
then
the
extreme
forms
from
being
the
most
useful
to
the
communitg
havinibeen
produced
in
greater
and
greater
numbers
through
the
natural
selection
of
the
parents
which
generated
them
until
none
with
an
inter
mediate
structure
were
produced
thus
as
believe
the
wonderful
fact
of
two
distinctly
defined
castes
of
sterile
workers
existing
in
the
same
nest
both
widely
different
from
each
other
and
from
their
parents
has
originated
we
can
see
how
useful
their
rrodnction
may
have
been
to
social
community
of
nsects
on
the
same
principle
that
the
division
of
labour
is
useful
to
civilised
man
as
ants
work
by
inherited
instincts
and
by
inherited
tools
or
weapons
and
not
by
acquired
knowledge
and
manufactured
instruments
per
fect
division
of
labour
could
be
effected
with
them
only
by
the
workers
being
sterile
for
had
they
been
fertile
they
would
have
intercrossed
and
their
instinets
and
structure
would
have
become
blended
and
nature
has
as
believe
effected
this
admirable
division
of
labour
in
the
communities
of
ants
by
the
means
of
natural
selec
tion
but
am
bound
to
confess
that
with
all
my
faith
this
principle
should
never
have
anticipated
that
natural
selection
could
have
been
efficient
in
so
high
degree
had
not
the
case
of
these
neuter
insects
convinced
me
of
the
fact
have
therefore
discussed
this
case
at
some
little
but
wholly
insufficient
length
in
order
to
show
the
power
of
natural
selection
and
likewise
because
this
is
by
far
the
most
serious
special
difficulty
which
my
theory
has
encountered
the
case
also
is
very
interesting
as
it
proves
that
with
animals
as
with
plants
any
amount
of
modification
in
structure
can
be
cffected
by
the
accu
maulation
of
numerous
slight
and
as
we
must
call
them
cuar
vii
summary
213
accidental
variations
which
are
in
any
manner
profitable
without
exercise
or
habit
having
come
into
play
for
no
amount
of
exercise
or
habit
or
volition
in
the
utterly
sterile
members
of
community
could
possibly
have
affected
the
structure
or
instincts
of
the
fertile
members
which
alone
leave
descendants
am
surprised
that
no
one
has
advanced
this
demonstrative
case
of
neuter
insects
against
the
well-known
doctrine
of
lamarck
summary.—1i
have
endeavoured
briefly
in
this
chapter
to
show
that
the
mental
qualities
of
our
domestic
animals
vary
and
that
the
variations
are
inherited
still
more
briefly
have
attempted
to
show
that
instincts
vary
slightly
in
state
of
nature
no
one
will
dispute
that
instincts
are
of
the
highest
importance
to
each
animal
therefore
can
see
no
difficulty
under
changing
condi
tions
of
life
in
natural
selection
accumulating
slight
modifications
of
instinct
to
any
extent
in
any
useful
direction
in
some
cases
habit
or
use
and
disuse
have
probably
come
into
play
do
not
pretend
that
the
facts
given
in
this
chapter
strengthen
in
any
great
degree
my
theory
but
none
of
the
cases
of
difficulty
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
annihilate
it
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
instincts
are
not
always
absolutely
perfect
and
are
liable
to
mistakes
that
no
instinct
has
been
produced
for
the
exclusive
good
of
other
animals
but
that
each
animal
takes
advantage
of
the
instincts
of
others
that
the
canon
in
natural
history
of
natura
non
facit
saltum
is
applicable
to
instincts
as
well
as
to
corporeal
structure
and
18
plainly
explicable
on
the
foregoing
views
but
is
otherwise
inexplicable,—all
tend
to
corroborate
the
theory
of
natural
selection
this
theory
is
also
strengthened
by
some
few
other
facts

the
importance
of
the
fact
that
hybrids
are
very
generally
sterile
has
think
been
much
underrated
by
some
late
writers
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
the
case
is
especially
important
inasmuch
as
the
sterility
of
hybrids
could
not
fossibly
be
of
any
advantage
to
them
and
therefore
could
not
have
beenh
acquired
the
con

of

however
to
be

that
ste

not

but
is
incidental
on

in
treating
this
subject
two
classes
of
facts
to
large
extent
fundamentally
different
have
ﬁenerally
been
con
founded
together
namely
the
sterility
of
two
species
when
first
crossed
and
the
sterility
of
the
hybrids
pro
duced
from
them
pure
species
have

their

mybrids
on

a8
may
be
clearly
seen
in
the
state
of
the
male
element
in
both
plants
and
animals
though
the
organs
themselves
are
ggrfect
in
structure
as
far
as
the
micro
scope
reveals
the
first
case
the
two
sexual
elements
which
go
to
form
the
embryo
are
perfect
in
the
second
case
they
are
either
not
at
all
developed
or
are
imper
fectly
developed
this
distinction
is
important
when
the
cause
of
the
sterility
which
is
common
to
the
two
cases
has
to
be
considered
the
distinction
has
irobably
been
slurred
over
owing
to
the
sterility
in
both
cases
being
looked
on
as
special
endowment
beyond
the
province
of
our
reasoning
powers
the
fertility
of
varieties
that
is
of
the
forms
known
or
believed
to
have
descended
from
common
parents
when
intercrossed
and
likewise
the
fertility
of
their
mongrel
offspring
is
on
my
theory
of
equal
importance
with
the
stenlity
of
species
for
it
secms
to
make
broad
and
clear
distinction
between
varieties
and
species
first
for
the
sterility
of
species
when
crossed
and
of
their
hybrid
offspring
it
is
impossible
to
study
the
sev
eral
memoirs
ang
works
of
those
two
conscientious
and
admirable
observers
kolreuter
and
girtner
who
almost
devoted
their
lives
to
this
subject
without
being
deeply
impressed
with
the
hni.eh
generality
of
some
degree
of
ste
rility
kolreuter
makes
the
rule
universal
but
then
he
cuts
the
knot
for
in
ten
cases
in
which
he
found
two
forms
considered
by
most
authors
as
distinct
species
quite
fertile
together
he
unhesitatingly
ranks
them
as
va
rieties
qirtner
also
makes
the
rule
equally
universal
and
he
disputes
the
entire
fertility
of
k¢lreuter’s
ten
cases
but
in
these
and
in
many
other
cases
girtner
is
obliged
carefully
to
count
the
seeds
in
order
to
show
that
there
is
any
degree
of
sterility
he
always
compares
the
maxi
mum
number
of
seeds
produced
by
two
species
when
crossed
and
by
their
hybrid
offspring
with
the
average
number
produced
by
both
pure-parent
species
in
stato
of
nature
but
serious
cause
of
error

to
me
to
be
here

trated
and
what
is
often
more
important
must
be
se
cluded
in
order
to
prevent
pollen
being
brought
to
it
by
insects
from
other
plants
nearly
all
the
pﬁmts
experi
mentised
on
by
girtner
were
potted
and
apparently
were
kept
in
chamber
in
his
house
that
these
processes
are
often
injurious
to
the
fertility
of
plant
cannot
be
doubt
ed
for
girtner
gives
in
his
table
about
score
of
cases
of
telantzs
which
he
castrated
and
artificially
fertilised
with
their
own
pollen
and
excluding
all
cases
such
as
the
leguminoss
in
which
there
is
an
acknowledged
difficult
in
the
manipulation
half
of
these
twenty
plants
had
their
fertility
in
some
degree
impaired
moreover
as
girtner
during
several
years
repeatedly
crossed
the
primrose
and
cowslip
which
we
have
such
good
reasons
to
believe
to
be
varieties
and
only
once
or
twice
succeeded
in
getting
fertile
seed
as
he
found
the
common
red
and
blue
pim
{:ernels
anagallis
arvensis
and
ccerulea
which
the
best
otanists
rank
as
varieties
absolutely
sterile
together
and
as
he
came
to
the
same
conclusion
in
several
other
analogous
cases
it
seems
to
me
that
we
may
well
be
permitted
to
doubt
whether
many
other
species
are
really
so
sterile
when
intercrossed
as
girtner
believes
it
is
certain
on
the
one
hand
that
the
sterility
of
va
rious
species
when
crossed
is
so
different
in
degree
and
graduates
away
so
insensibly
and
on
the
other
hand
that
the
fertility
of
pure
species
1s
so
easily
affected
by
various
circumstances
that
for
all
practical
purposes
it
is
most
difficult
to
say
where
perfect
fertility
ends
and
sterility
begins
think
no
better
evidence
of
this
can
be
required
than
that
the
two
most
experienced
observers
who
have
ever
lived
namely
kolreuter
and
giirtner
should
have
arrived
at
diametrically
opposite
conclusions
in
regard
to
the
very
same
species
it
is
also
most
instructive
to
com
pare—but
have
not
space
here
to
enter
on
details—the
evidence
advanced
by
our
best
botanists
on
the
question
whether
certain
doubtful
forms
should
be
ranked
as
spe
cies
or
varietics
with
the
evidence
from
fertility
adduced
by
different
hybridisers
or
by
the
same
author
from
ex
periments
made
during
different
years
it
can
thus
be
shown
that
neither
sterility
nor
fertility
affords
any
clear
290
hybridism
cmar
viil
distinction
between
species
and
varieties
but
that
the
evidence
from
this
source
graduates
away
and
is
doubt
ful
in
the
same
degree
as
is
the
evidence
derived
from
other
constitutional
and
structural
differences
in
regard
to
the
sterility
of
hybrids
in
successive
gﬁ
erations
though
gartner
was
enabled
to
rear
some
hy
brids
carefully
guiding
them
from
cross
with
either
pure
parent
for
six
or
seven
and
in
one
case
for
ten
gen
erations
yet
he
asserts
positively
that
their
fertility
never
increased
but
generally
greatly
decreased
do
not
doubt
that
this
is
usually
the
case
and
that
the
fertility
often
suddenly
decreases
in
the
first
few
generations
nevertheless
believe
that
in
all
these
experiments
the
fertility
has
been
diminished
by
an
independent
cause
namely
from
close
interbreeding
have
collected
so
large
body
of
facts
showing
that
close
interbreedin
lessens
fertility
and
on
the
other
hand
that
an
occasion
cross
with
distinet
individual
or
variety
increases
fertili
ty
that
cannot
doubt
the
correctness
of
this
almost
uni
versal
belief
amongst
breeders
hybrids
are
seldom
raised
by
experimentalists
in
great
numbers
and
as
the
parcnt-species
or
other
allied
hybrids
generally
grow
in
the
same
garden
the
visits
of
insects
must
be
carefully
prevented
during
the
flowering
season
hence
hybrids
will
generally
be
fertilised
during
each
generation
by
their
own
ind’i,vidual
pollen
and
i'am
convinced
that
this
would
be
injurious
to_their
fertility
already
lessened
by
their
hybrid
origin
am
strengthened
in
this
conviction
by
remarkable
statement
repeatedly
made
by
giirtner
namely
that
if
even
the
less
fertile
hybrids
be
artificially
fertilised
with
hybrid
pollen
of
the
same
kind
their
fer
tility
notwithstanding
the
frequent
ill
effects
of
manipu
lation
sometimes
decidedly
increases
and
goes
on
increas
igﬁ
now
in
artificial
f)elrtilisation
pollen
is
as
often
taken
by
chance
as
know
from
my
own
experience
from
the
anthers
of
another
flower
as
from
the
anthers
of
the
flower
itself
which
is
to
be
fertilised
so
that
cross
between
two
flowers
though
probably
on
the
same
plant
would
be
thus
effected
moreover
whenever
complicat
ed
experiments
are
in
progress
so
careful
an
observer
as
cmr
viil
sterility
221
girtner
would
have
castrated
his
hybrids
and
this
would
have
insured
in
each
gencration
cross
with
pollen
from
distinet
flower
either
from
the
same
plant
or
from
another
plant
of
the
same
hybrid
nature
and
thus
the
strange
fact
of
the
incrense
of
fertility
in
the
successive
generations
of
artificially
ifertilieed
hybrids
may
be
lieve
be
accounted
for
by
close
interbreeding
having
been
avoided
now
let
us
turn
to
the
results
arrived
at
by
the
third
most
experienced
hybridiser
namely
the
hon
and
rev
w
herbert
he
is
as
emphatic
in
his
conclusion
that
some
hybrids
are
perfectly
fertile—as
fertile
as
the
pure
arent
species—as
are
kolreuter
and
giirtner
that
some
gegree
of
steri]itﬁbetween
distinet
species
is
universal
law
of
nature
he
experimentised
on
some
of
the
very
same
species
a8
did
gartner
the
difference
in
their
re
sults
may
think
be
in
part
accounted
for
by
herbert’s
eat
horticultural
skill
and
by
his
having
hothouses
at
command
of
his
many
important
statements
will
here
give
only
single
one
as
an
example
namely
that
«
every
ovule
in
pod
of
crinum
capense
fertilised
by
c
revolutum
produced
plant
which
he
says
never
saw
to
occur
in
case
of
its
natural
fecundation
so
that
we
here
have
perfect
or
even
more
than
commonly
perfect
fertility
in
first
cross
between
two
distinct
species
this
case
of
the
crinum
leads
me
to
refer
to
most
sintin]ar
fact
namely
that
there
are
individual
plants
as
with
certain
ecies
of
lobelia
and
with
all
the
species
of
the
genus
hippeastrum
which
can
be
far
more
easily
fertilised
by
the
pollen
of
another
and
distinct
species
than
by
their
own
pollen
for
these
plants
have
been
found
to
yield
seed
to
the
pollen
of
distinct
species
though
quite
sterile
with
their
own
pollen
notwithstand
ing
that
their
own
pollen
was
found
to
be
perfectly
good
for
it
fertilised
distinct
species
so
that
certain
individual
plants
and
all
the
individuals
of
certain
species
can
ac
tually
be
hybridised
much
more
readily
than
they
can
be
self-fertilised
for
instance
bulb
of
hippeastrum
auli
cum
produced
four
flowers
three
were
fertilised
by
her
bert
with
their
own
pollen
and
the
fourth
was

hybridism
cmar
viil
uently
fertilised
by
the
pollen
of
compound
hybrid
3escendod
from
three
other
and
distinct
species
the
result
was
that
the
ovaries
of
the
three
first
flowers
soon
ceased
to
grow
and
after
few
days
perished
entirely
whereas
the
pod
impregnated
by
the
pollen
of
the
hybrid
made
vigorous
growth
and
rapid
progress
to
maturity
and
bore
ood
seed
which
vegetated
freely
in
letter
to
me
in
1839
mr
herbert
told
me
that
he
had
then
tried
the
experiment
during
five
years
and
he
continued
to
try
it
during
several
subsequent
years
and
always
with
the
same
result
this
result
has
also
been
confirmed
by
other
observers
in
the
case
of
hipﬁ)eastmm
with
its
sub
enera
and
in
the
case
of
some
other
genera
as
lobelia
%‘assiﬂora
and
verbascum
although
the
plants
in
these
experiments
appeared
perfectly
healthy
and
al
though
both
the
ovules
and
pollen
of
the
same
flower
were
perfectly
good
with
respect
to
other
species
yet
as
they
were
functionally
imperfect
in
their
mutual
self
action
we
must
infer
that
the
plants
were
in
an
unnatural
state
nevertheless
these
facts
show
on
what
slight
and
mysterious
causes
the
lesser
or
greater
fertility
ot
species
when
crossed
in
comparison
with
the
same
species
when
self-fertilised
sometimes
depends
the
practical
experiments
of
horticulturists
though
not
made
with
scientific
precision
deserve
some
notice
it
is
notorious
in
how
complicated
manner
the
species
of
pelargonium
fuchsia
calceolaria

rhodo
dendron
&c
have
been
crossed
yet
many
of
these
hybrids

herbert
asserts
that
hybrid
from
calceolaria
integrifolia
and
plantaginea
species
most
widely
dissimilar

habit
reproduced
itself
as
perfectly
as
if
it
had

chile
have
taken
some
pains
to
ascer

the
degree
of

of
some
of
the
complex
crosses
of
rhododendrons
and
am
assured
that
many
of
them
arc

c

for
instance
informs
me
that
he
raises
stocks
for
grafting
from

rhod
ponticum
and

iense
and
that
this
hybrid
seeds
as
freely
as
it
is
possible
to
imagine
ad
hybrids
when
fairly
treated
gone
on
decreasing
in
o

293
fertility
in

successive
generation
as
gértner
believes
to
be
the
case
the
fact
would
have
been
notorious
to
nur
serymen
horticulturists
raise
large
beds
of
the
same
hybrids
and
such
alone
are
fairly
treated
for
by
insect
agencf
the
several
individuals
of
the

hybrid
variety
are
allowed
to
freely
cross
with
each
other
and
the
in
jurions
influence
of
close
interbreeding
is
thus
prevented
any
one
may
readily
convince
himself
of
the
efficiency
of
insect
agency
by
examining
the
flowers
of
the
more
sterile
kinds
of
hybrid
rhododendrons
which
produce
no

for

on

plenty

in

to

much
fewer
experiments
have
been
carefully
tried
than
with
tgylants
if
our
systematic
arrangements
can
be
trusted
that
is
if
the
genera
of
ani
mals
are
as
distinet
from
each

as
are
the
genera
of
plants
then
we
may
infer
that
animals
more
widely
sep
arated
in
the
scale
of
nature
can
be
more
easily
crossed
than
in
the
case
of
plants
but
the
hybrids
themselves
are
think
more
sterile
doubt
whether
any
case
of
perfectly
fertile
hybrid
animal
can
be
considered
as
thoroughly
well
authenticated
it
should
however
be
borne
in
mind
that
owing
to
few
animals
breeding
freely
under
confinement
few
experiments
have
been
fairl
tried
for

we

no

that

two

in

it

sur%rising
that

the
case
of
any
pure
animal
which
from
any
cause
had
the
least
tendency
to
sterility
the
breed
would
assuredly
be
lost
in
very
few
generations
although
do
not
know
of
any
thoroughly
well
authenticated
cases
of
perfectly
fertile
hybrid
animals
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
the

from

with
p

and
with

are
perfectly

there
is
no
doubt
that
these
three
pheasants
namely
the
common
the
true
ring-necked

the

inter

and
are

blended
together
in
the
woods
of
several
parts
of
england
the
hybrids
from
the
common
and
chinese
geese
a
cygnoides
species
which
are
so
different
that
they
are
generally
ranked
in
distinct
genera
have
often
bred
in
this
country
with
either
pure
parent
and
in
one
sin
i}e
instance
they
have
bred
inter
se
this
was
effected
by
r
eyton
who
raised
two
hybrids
from
the
same
parents
but
from
different
hatches
and
from
these
two
birds
he
raised
no
less
than
eight
hybrids
grandchildren
of
the
gure
geese
from
one
nest
india
however
these
cross
red
geese
must
be
far
more
fertile
for
am
assured
by
two
eminently
capable
judges
namely
mr
blyth
and
capt
hutton
that
whole
flocks
of
these
geese
are
kept
in
various
earts
of
the
country
and
as
they
are
kept
for
profit
where
neither
pure
parent-species
exists
they
must
certainly
be
highly
fertile
doctrine
whyich
originated
with
pallas
has
been
largely
accepted
by
modgelm
naturalists
namely
that
most
of
our
domestic
animals
have
descended
from
two
or
more
aboriginal
species
since
commingled
by
intercross
ing
on
this
view
the
original
species
must
either
at
first
have
produced
quite
fertile
hybrids
or
the
hybrids
must
have
become
in
subsequent
generations
quite
i";rtile
under
domestication
this
}atter
alternative
seems
to
me
the
most
probable
and
am
inclined
to
believe
in
its
truth
although
it
rests
on
no
direct
evidence
believe
for
instance
that
our
dogs
have
descended
from
several
wild
stocks
yet
with
perhaps
the
exception
of
certain
indig
enous
domestic
dogs
of
south
america
all
are
quite
fertile
together
and
analogy
makes
me
greatly
doubt
whether
gxea
several
aboriginal
species
would
at
first
have
onar
viil
laws
of
bterility
295
freely
bred
together
and
have
produced
quite
feruile
hybrids
so
in
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
our
umﬁem
and
the
humped
indian
cattle
are
quite
fertile
together
but
from
facts
communicated
to
me
by
mr
blyth
think
they
must
be
considered
as
distinct
species
on
this
view
of
the
origin
of
many
of
our
domestic
ani
mals
we
must
either
%ive
up
the
belief
of
the
almost
universal
sterility
of
distinct
species
of
animals
when
crossed
or
we
must
look
at
sterility
not
as
an
indelible
characteristic
but
as
one
capable
of
being
removed
by
domestication
finally
looking
to
all
the
ascertained
facts
on
the
intercrossing
of
plants
and
animals
it
may
be
concluded
that
some
degree
of
sterility
both
in
first
crosses
and
in
hybrids
is
an
extremely
general
result
but
that
it
can
not
under
our
present
state
of
knowledge
be
considered
as
absolutely
universal
laws
governing
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids—we
will
now
consider
little
more
in
detail
the
circumstances
and
rules
governing
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
ggr
chief
object
will
be
to
see
whether
or
not
the
rules
indicate
that
species
have
specially
been
endowed
with
this
quality
in
order
to
pre
vent
their
crossing
and
blending
together
in
utter
con
fusion
the
following
rules
and
conclusions
are
chiefl
drawn
up
from
girtner’s
admirable
work
on
the
hybridi
sation
of
plants
have
taken
much
pains
to
ascertain
how
far
the
rules
apply
to
animals
and
considering
how
scanty
our
knowledge
is
in
regard
to
hybrid
animals
have
been
sﬂ!ill'l;lsed
to
find
how
generally
the
same
rules
apply
to
both
ﬁgoms
it
has
been
already
remarked
that
the
degree
of
fer
tility
both
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
graduates
from
zero
to
perfect
fertility
it
is
surprising
in
how
many
curious
ways
this
gradation
can
be
shown
to
exist
but
only
the
barest
outline
of
the
facts
can
here
be
given
when
pollen
from
plant
of
one
family
is
placed
on
the
ltligma
of
plant
of
distinet
family
it
exerts
no
more
influence
than
so
much
inorganic
dust
from
this
abso
lute
zero
of
fertility
the
pollen
of
different
species
of
296
hybridism
cmar
viil
the
same
genus
applied
to
the
stigma
of
some
one
species
yields
perfect
gradation
in
the
number
of
seeds
pro
duced
up
to
nearly
complete
or
even
quite
complete
fer
tility
and
as
we
have
seen
in
certain
abnormal
cases
even
to
an
excess
of
fertility
beyond
that
which
the
plant’s
own
pollen
will
produce
so
in
hybrids
themselves
there
are
some
which
never
have
produced
and
probably
never
would
produce
even
with
the
pollen
of
either
pure
parent
single
fertile
seed
but
in
somne
of
these
cases
first
trace
of
fertility
may
be
detected
by
the
pollen
of
one
of
the
pure
parent-species
causing
the
flower
of
the
hybrid
to
wither
carlier
than
it
otherwise
would
have
done
and
the
early
withering
of
the
flower
is
well
known
to
be
sign
of
ineipient
fertilisation
from
this
extreme
degree
of
steril
ity
we
have
self-fertilised
hybrids
prodncini
greater
and
greater
number
of
seeds
up
to
perfect
fertility
hybrids
from
two
species
which
are
very
difficult
to
cross
and
which
rarely
produce
any
offspring
are
gener
ally
very
sterile
but
the
parallelism
between
the
dif
ficulty
of
making
first
cross
and
the
sterility
of
the
hybrids
thus
produced—two
classes
of
facts
which
are
ﬁnerally
confounded
together—is
by
no
means
strict
ere
are
many
cases
in
which
two
pure
species
can
be
united
with
unusual
facilit{
and
produce
numerous
hybrid-offspring
yet
these
hybrids
are
remarkably
sterile
on
the
other
hand
there
are
species
which
can
be
crossed
very
rarely
or
with
extreme
difficulty
but
the
hybrids
when
at
last
produced
are
very
fertile
even
within
the
limits
of
the
same
genus
for
instance
in
dianthus
these
two
opposite
cases
occur
the
fertility
both
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
is
more
easily
affected
by
unfavourable
conditions
than
is
the
fertility
of
pure
species
but
the
degree
of
fertility
is
likewise
innately
variable
for
it
is
not
always
the
same
when
the
same
two
species
are
crossed
under
the
same
circumstances
but
depends
in
part
upon
the
consti
tution
of
the
individuals
which
happen
to
have
been
chosen
for
the
experiment
so
it
is
with
hybrids
for
their
degree
of
fertility
is
often
found
to
differ
greatly
in
the
several
individuals
raised
from
seed
out
of
the
same
capsule
and
exposed
to
exactly
the

by
the

the
resem

between

in

in

especially
in
the
structure
of

which
are
of

1}‘i:}lysiological
importance
and
which

in
the

now
the
fertility
of

crosses
be

species
and
of
the
hybrids
produced
from

is
largely
governed
by
their
systematic

this
is
clearly

by

never

ranked
by

is
sufficient
to
prevent
two

can
be
shown
that

with
female-ass
and
then
male-ass
with

these
two
species
may
then
be
said
to
have
been
reciprocally
crossed
there
is
often
the
widest
possible
difference
in
the
facility
of
making
reciprocal
crosses
such
cases
are
highly
important
for
they
prove
that
the
ca(;mcity
in
any
two
species
to
cross
is
often
completely
independent
of
their
systematic
affinity
or
of
any
recognisable
differenco
in
their
whole
organisation
on
the
other
hand
these
cases
clearly
show
that
the
capacity
for
crossing
is
con
nected
with
constitutional
differences
imperceptible
by
us
and
confined
to
the
reproductive
system
this
difference
in
the
result
of
reciprocal
crosses
between
the

two
species
was
long
ago
observed
by
kolreuter
to
give
an
instance
mirabilis
jalappa
can
easily
be
fertilised
dy
the
pollen
of
m
longiflora
and
the
hybrids
thus
produced
are
sufficiently
fertile
but
kolreuter
tried
more
than
two
hundred
times
during
eight
following
years
to
fertilise
reciprocally
m
longiflora
with
the
pollen
of
m
jalappa
and
utterly
failed
several
other
equally
striking
cases
could
be
given
thuret
has
observe%
the
same
fact
with
certain
sea-weeds
or
fuci
girtner
moreover
found
that
this
difference
of
facility
in
making
reciprocal
crosses
is
extremely
common
in
lesser
degree
he
has
observed
it
even
between
forms
so
closely
related
as
matthiola
annua
and
glabra
that
many
botanists
rank
them
onl
a8
varieties
it
is
also
remarkable
fact
that
hybri
raised
from
reciprocal
crosses
though
of
course
comﬁound
ed
of
the
very
same
two
species
the
one
species
having
first
been
used
as
the
father
and
then
as
the
mother
gen
gmlly
differ
in
fertility
in
small
and
occasionally
in
high
egree
several
other
singular
rules
could
be
given
from
girt
ner
for
instance
some
species
have
remarkable
power
of
crossing
with
other
species
other
species
of
the
same
genus
have
remarkable
power
of
impressing
their
like
ness
on
their
hybrid
offspring
but
these
two
powers
do
not
at
all
necessarily
go
together
there
are
certain
hy
brids
which
instead
og(l)laving
a8
is
usual
an
intermediate
character
between
their
two
parents
always
closely
re
semble
one
of
them
and
such
hybrids
though
externally
crmar
viil
compared
with
grafting
229
80
like
one
of
their
pure
parent
species
are
with
rare
ex
ceptions
extremely
sterile
so
again
amongst
hybrids
which
are
usually
intermediate
in
structure
between
their
parents
exceptional
and
abnormal
individuals
sometimes
are
born
which
closeiy
resemble
one
of
their
pure
parents
and
these
hybrids
are
almost
always
utterly
sterile
ever
when
the
other
hybrids
raised
from
seed
from
the
same
capsule
have
considerable
degree
of
fertility
these
facts
show
how
completely
fertility
in
the
hybrid
is
indepen
dent
of
its
external
resemblance
to
either
pure
parent
considering
the
several
rules
now
given
which
gov
ern
the
fertility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
we
see
that
when
forms
which
must
be
considered
as
good
and
distinct
species
are
united
their
fertility
graduates
from
zero
to
perfect
fertility
or
even
to
fertility
under
certain
conditions
in
excess
that
their
fertility
besides
being
eminently
susceptible
to
favourable
and
unfavourable
con
ditions
1s
innately
variable
that
it
is
by
no
means
always
the
same
in
degree
in
the
first
cross
and
in
the
hybrids
produced
from
this
cross
that
the
fertility
of
hybrids
is
not
related
to
the
degree
in
which
they
resemble
in
external
appearance
either
parent
and
lastly
that
the
facility
of
making
first
cross
between
any
two
species
is
not
always
governed
by
their
systematic
affinity
or
degree
of
resemblance
to
each
other
this
latter
state
ment
is
clearly
proved
by
reciprocal
crosses
between
the
same
two
species
for
according
as
the
one
species
or
the
other
is
used
as
the
father
or
the
mother
there
is
generall
some
difference
and
occasionally
the
widest
possible
diz
ference
in
the
facility
of
effécting
an
union
hybrids
moreover
produced
from
reciprocal
crosses
often
differ
in
fertility
now
do
these
complex
and
singular
rules
indicate
that
species
have
been
endowed
with
sterility
simply
to
prevent
their
becoming
confounded
in
nature
think
not
for
why
should
the
sterility
be
so
extremely
differ
ent
in
degree
when
various
species
are
crossed
all
of
which
we
must
suppose
it
would
be
equally
impoytant
to
keep
from
blending
together
why
should
the
degree
of
sterility
be
innately
variable
in
the
individuals
of
the
230
hybridism
{cmar
viil
same
species
why
should
some
species
cross
with
faeil
ity
and
yet
produce
very
sterile
hybrids
and
other
species
cross
with
extreme
diﬂicu]tx
and
yect
produce
fairly
fertile
hybrids
why
should
there
often
be
so
great
difference
in
the
result
of
reciprocal
cross
be
tween
the
same
two
species
why
it
may
even
be
ask
ed
has
the
production
of
hybrids
been
permitted
to
grant
to
species
the
special
power
of
producing
hybrids
and
then
to
stop
their
further
propagation
by
different
of
sterility
not
strictly
related
to
the
facility
of
the
first
union
between
their
parents
seems
to
be
strange
ar
rangement
foregoing
rules
and
facts
on
the
other
hand
appear
to
me
clearl{
to
indicate
that
the
sterility
both
o
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
is
simply
incidental
or
de
pendent
on
unknown
differences
chiefly
in
the
reproduc
tive
systems
of
the
species
which
are
crossed
the
differ
ences
being
of
so
peculiar
and
limited
nature
that
in
reciprocal
crosses
between
two
species
the
male
sexumal
element
of
the
one
will
often
freely
act
on
the
female
sexual
element
of
the
other
but
not
in
reversed
direc
tion
it
will
be
advisable
to
explain
little
more
fully
by
an
example
what
mean
by
sterility
being
incidental
on
other
differences
and
not
specially
endowed
quality
as
the
capacity
of
one
plant
to
ge
grafted
or
budded
on
another
is
so
entirely
unimportant
for
its
welfare
in
state
of

presume
that
no
one
will
suppose
that
this
capacity
is
apecially

will
admit
that
it
is
incidental
on
differences
in
the
laws
of

of
the
two

we
can
sometimes
see
the
reason
wh
one
tree
will
not
take
on
another
from
differences
in
their
rate
of
growth
in
the
hardness
of
their
wood
in
the
period
of
the
flow
or
nature
of
their

&c
but
in
multitude
of
cases
we
can
assign
no
reason
whatever
great
diver

in
the
size
of
two
plants
one
being
woody
and
the
other

one
being
evergreen

the
other
deciduous
and
adaptation
to
widely
different

does
not_always
prevent
the
two
grafting
together
as
in

so
with
grafting
the
capacity
is
limited

by

although

the

on

of

sagaret
believes
this
to
be
the
case
with
different
individuals
of
the
same
two
species
in
bein
grafted
together
as
in
reciprocal
crosses
the
facility
of
effecting
an
union
is
often
very
far
from
equal
so
it
some
times
is
in
grafting
the
common
gooseberry
for
instance
cannot
be
grafted
on
the
currant
whereas
the
currant
will
take
though
with
difficulty
on
the
gooseberry
we
have
seen
that
the
sterility
of
hybrids
which
have
their
reproductive
organs
in
an
imperfect
condition
is
very
different
case
from
the
difficulty
of
uniting
two
rtpure
species
which
have
their
reproductive
organs
perfect
et
these
two
distinct
cases
run
to
certain
extent
paral
el
something
analogous
occurs
in
grafting
for
thouin
found
that
three
species
of
robinia
which
seeded
freely
on
their
own
roots
and
which
could
be
grafted
with
no
great
difficulty
on
another
species
when
thus
grafted
were
rendered
barren
on
the
other
hand
certain
species
of
sorbus
when
grafted
on
other
species
yielded
twice
as
much
fruit
as
when
on
their
own
roots
we
are
remind
ed
by
this
latter
fact
of
the
extraordinary
case
of
hippe
astrum
lobelia
&c
which
seeded
much
more
freely
when
fertilised
with
the
pollen
of
distinct
species
than
when
self-fertilised
with
their
own
pollen
we
thus
see
that
although
there
is
clear
and
funda
289
hybridism
oxmar
viil
mental
difference
between
the
mere
adhesion
of
grafted
stocks
and
the
union
of
the
male
and
female
elements
in
the
act
of
reproduction
yet
that
there
is
rude
degree
of
parallelism
in
the
results
of
grafting
and
of
crossing
dis
tinet
species
and
as
we
must
look
at
the
curious
and
complex
laws
governing
the
facility
with
which
trees
can
be
grafted
on
each
other
as
incidental
or
unknown
differ
ences
in
their
vegetative
systems
so
believe
that
the
still
more
complex
laws
governing
the
facility
of
first
crosses
are
incidental
on
unknown
differences
chiefly
in
their
re{)roductive
systems
these
differences
in
both
cases
follow
to
certain
extent
as
might
have
been
ex
bected
systematic
affinity
by
which
every
kind
of
resem
lance
and
dissimilarity
between
organic
beings
is
at
tempted
to
be
expressed
the
fact
by
no
means
seems
to
me
to
indicate
that
the
greater
or
lesser
difficulty
of
either
grafting
or
crossing
together
various
species
has
been
sigecial
endowment
although
in
the
case
of
crossing
the
ifficulty
is
as
important
for
the
endurance
and
stability
of
specific
forms
as
in
the
case
of
grafting
it
is
unimpor
tant
for
their
welfare
causes
of
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
we
may
now
look
little
closer
at
the
probable
causes
of
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
these
two
cases
are
fundamentally
different
for
as
just
remarked
in
the
union
of
two
pure
species
the
male
and
female
sex
ual
elements
are
perfect
whereas
in
hybrids
they
are
im
perfect
even
in
first
crosses
the
greater
or
lesscr
diffi
culty
in
effecting
an
union
apparently
depends
on
several
distinet
causes
there
must
sometimes
be
physical
impossibility
in
the
male
element
reaching
the
ovule
as
would
be
the
case
with
plant
having
pistil
too
long
for
the
pollen
tubes
to
reach
the
ovarium
it
has
also
been
observed
that
when
pollen
of
one
species
is
placed
on
the
stigma
of
distantly
allied
species
though
the
pollen-tubes
protrude
they
do
not
penetrate
the
stigmatic
surface
again
the
male
element
may
reach
the
female
element
but
be
incapable
of
causing
an
embryo
to
be
developed
as
seems
to
have
been
the
case
with
some
of
thuret’s
cmar
viil
causes
of
sterility
988
experiments
on
fuci
no
explanation
can
be
given
of
these
facts
any
more
than
why
certain
trees
cannot
be
grafted
on
others
lastly
an
embryo
may
be
developed
and
then
perish
at
an
early
period
is
latter
alternative
has
not
been
sufficiently
attended
to
but
believe
from
observations
communicated
to
me
by
mr
hewitt
who
has
had
great
experience
in
hybridising
gallinaceous
birds
that
the
early
death
of
the
embryo
is
very
frequent
cause
of
steri.ﬁty
in
first
crosses
r{
was
at
first
very
un
willing
to
believe
in
this
view
as
hybrids
when
once
born
are
generally
healthy
and
long-lived
as
we
see
in
the
case
of
the
common
mule
hybrids
however
are
differently
circumstanced
before
and
after
birth
when
born'and
living
in
country
where
their
two
parents
can
live
they
are
generally
placed
under
suitable
conditions
of
life
but
a%lybrid
partakes
of
only
half
of
the
nature
and
constitution
of
its
motherl
and
therefore
before
birth
as
long
as
it
is
nourished
within
its
mother’s
womb
or
within
the
egg
or
seed
produced
by
the
mother
it
may
be
exposed
to
conditions
in
some
degree
unsuitable
and
con
sequently
be
liable
to
perish
at
an
early
period
more
especially
as
all
very
young
beings
seem
eminently
sensi
tive
to
injurious
or
unnatural
conditions
of
life
in
regard
to
the
sterility
of
hybrids
in
which
the
sexual
elements
are
imperfectly
developed
the
case
is
very
different
have
more
than
once
alluded
to
large
body
of
facts
which
have
collected
showing
that
where
animals
and
plants
are
removed
from
their
natural
con
ditions
they
are
extremely
liable
to
have
their
reproduc
tive
systems
seriously
affected
this
in
fact
is
the
great
bar
to
the
domestication
of
animals
between
the
ster
ility
thus
superinduced
and
that
of
hybrids
there
are
many
points
of
similarity
in
both
cases
the
sterility
is
independent
of
general
health
and
is
often
accompanied
by
excess
of
size
or
great
luxuriance
in
both
cases
the
sterility
occurs
in
various
degrees
in
both
the
male
element
is
the
most
liable
to
be
effected
but
sometimes
the
female
more
than
the
male
in
both
the
tendency
goes
to
certain
extent
with
systematic
affinity
for
whole
groups
of
animals
and
plants
are
rendered
impotent
by
the
284
hybridism
omar
viil
same
unnataral
conditions
and
whole
groups
of
agecien
tend
to
produce
sterile
hybrids
on
the
other
hand
one
species
in
group
will
sometimes
resist
great
changes
of
conditions
with
unimpaired
fertility
and
certain
species
in
group
will
produce
unusually
fertile
hybrids
no
one
can
tell
till
he
tries
whether
any
particular
animal
will
breed
under
confinement
or
any
plant
seed
freely
under
culture
nor
can
he
tell
till
he
tries
whether
any
two
sgecies
of
genus
will
produce
more
or
less
sterilo
hybrids
lastly
when
organic
beings
are
placed
during
several
generations
under
conditions
not
natural
to
them
they
are
extremely
liable
to
vary
which
is
due
as
be
lieve
to
their
reproductive
systems
having
been
specially
effected
though
in
lesser
than
when
sterility
ensues
so
it
is
with
hybrids
for
hybrids
in
successive
generations
are
eminently
liable
to
vary
as
every
experi
mentalist
has
observed
thus
we
see
that
when
organic
beings
are
placed
under
new
and
unnatural
conditions
and
when
lybrids
are
pro
duced
by
the
unnatural
crossing
of
two
species
the
re
ﬁx‘oductwe
system
independently
of
the
general
state
of
ealth
is
affected
by
sterility
in
very
similar
manner
in
the
one
case
the
conditions
of
life
have
been
disturbed
though
often
in
so
slight
degree
as
to
be
innappreciable
by
us
in
the
other
case
or
that
of
hybrids
the
external
conditions
have
remained
the
same
but
the
organisation
has
been
disturbed
by
two
different
structures
and
consti
tutions
having
been
blended
into
one
for
it
is
scarcely
sible
that
two
organisations
should
be
compounded
into
one
without
some
disturbance
occurring
in
the
devel
opment
or
periodical
action
or
mutual
relation
of
the
different
parts
and
organs
one
to
another
or
to
the
condi
tions
of
life
when
hybrids
are
able
to
breed
sater
se
they
transmit
to
their
offspring
from
generation
to
generation
the
same
compounded
organisation
and
hence
we
need
not
be
surprised
that
their
sterility
though
in
some
degree
variable
rarely
diminishes
it
must
however
be
confessed
that
we
cannot
under
stand
excepting
on
vague
hypotheses
several
facts
with
respect
to
the
sterility
of
hybrids
for
instance
the
un
omar
vitl
uauses
of
sterility
235
equal
fertility
of
hybrids
produced
from
reciprocal
cross
es
or
the
increased
sterility
in
those
hybrids
which
oc
casionally
and
exceptionally
resemble
c]%sely
either
pure
parent
nor
do
pretend
that
the
foregoing
remarks
to
the
root
of
the
matter
no
explanation
is
offered
w
an
organism
when
placed
under
unnatural
conditions
18
rendered
sterile
that
have
attempted
to
show
is
that
in
two
cases
in
some
respects
allied
sterility
is
the
common
result,—in
the
onc
case
from
the
conditions
of
life
having
been
disturbed
in
the
other
case
from
the
or
nisation
having
been
disturbed
by
two
organisations
aving
been
compounded
into
one
it
may
seem
fanciful
but
suspect
that
similar
parallelism
extends
to
an
allied
yet
very
different
class
of
facts
it
is
an
old
and
almost
universal
belief
founded
think
on
considerable
body
of
evidence
that
slight
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
are
beneficial
to
all
living
things
we
see
this
acted
on
by
farmers
and
gardeners
in
their
frequent
exchanges
of
seed
tubers
&c
from
one
soil
or
climate
to
another
and
back
again
during
the
convalescence
of
animals
we
plainly
see
that
great
benefit
is
derived
from
almost
any
change
in
the
habits
of
life
again
both
with
plants
and
animals
there
is
abundant
evidence
that
cross
between
very
distinct
individuals
of
the
same
species
that
is
between
members
of
different
strains
or_sub-breeds
gives
vigor
and
fertility
to
the
off
spring
believe
indeed
from
the
facts
alluded
to
in
our
fourth
chapter
that
certain
amount
of
crossing
indispensable
even
with
hermaphrodites
and
that
close
inter-breeding
continued
during
several
generations
be
tween
the
nearest
relations
especially
if
these
be
kept
under
the
same
conditions
of
life
always
induces
weak
ness
and
sterility
in
the
progeny
hence
it
seems
that
on
the
one
hand
slight
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
benefit
all
organic
beings
and
on
the
other
hand
that
slight
crosses
that
is
crosses
between
the
males
and
females
of
the
same
species
which
have
varied
and
become
slightly
different
give
vigour
and
fertility
to
the
offspring
but
we
have
seen
that
greater
changes
or

often

can
not

myself
that
this

is
an
accident
or
an
illusion
both
series
of
facts
seem
to
be
connected
together
by
some
common
but
unknown
bond
which
is
essentially
related
to
the
principle
of

fertility
of

may
be
urged
as
most
forcible
ar%u
ment
that
there
must
be
some
essential
distinction
be
tween
species
and
varieties
and
that
there
must
be
some
error
in
all
the
foregoing
remarks
inasmuch
as
varieties
however
much
they
may
differ
from
each
other
in
external
appearance
cross
with
perfect
facility
and
yield
perfectly
fertile
offspring
fully
admit
that
this
is
almost.inva
riably
the
case
and
that
the
case
offers
great
difficulty
probably
something
here
remains
unexplained
but
if
we
look
to
varieties
produced
under
nature
we
are
imme
diately
involved
in
hopeless
difficulties
for
if
two
hitherto
reputed
varieties
be
found
in
any
degree
sterile
together
they
are
at
once
ranked
by
most
naturalists
as
species
for
instance
the
blue
and
red
pimpernel
the
primrose
and
cowslip
which
are
considered
by
many
of
our
best
bota
nists
as
varieties
are
said
by
girtner
not
to
be
quite
fer
tile
when
crossed
and
he
consequently
ranks
them
as
un
doubted
species
if
we
thus
argue
in
circle
the
fertility
of
all
varieties
preduced
under
nature
will
assuredly
have
to
be
granted
if
we
turn
to
varieties
produced,-or
supposed
to
have
been
produced
under
domestication
we
are
still
involved
in
doubt
for
when
it
is
stated
for
instance
that
the
german
spitz
dog
unites
more
easily
than
other
dogs
with
foxes
or
that
certain
south
american
indigenous
domes
tic
dogs
do
not
readily
cross
with
european
dogs
the
ex
planation
which
will
occur
to
every
one
and
probably
the
true
one
is
that
these
dogs
have
descended
from
several
aboriginally
distinct
species
nevertheless
the
perfect
fertility
of
so
many
domestic
varieties
differing
widely
from
each
other
in
appearance
for
instance
of
the
pigeon
omir
viil
fertility
of
mongrels
987
or
of
the
cabbage
is
remarkable
fact
more
especially
when
we
reflect
how
many
species
there
are
which
though
resembling
each
other
most
closely
are
utterly
sterile
when
intercrossed
several
considerations
how
ever
render
the
fertility
of
domestic
varieties
less
remark
able
than
at
first
appears
in
the
first
place
we
must
remember
how
ignorant
we
are
regarding
the
precise
cause
of
sterility
when
species
are
crossed
and
when
spe
cies
are
removed
from
their
natural
conditions
on
this
latter
head
have
not
had
space
to
adduce
the
many
re
markable
facts
which
could
have
been
given
with
re
spect
to
sterility
from
crossing
reflect
on
the
difference
in
result
of
reciprocal
crosses,—reflect
on
the
sin%ula.r
cases
in
which
plant
can
be
more
easily
fertilised
by
foreign
pollen
than
by
its
own
when
we
think
over
such
cases
and
on
that
of
the
different
coloured
varieties
of
verbascum
presently
to
be
given
we
must
feel
how
ignorant
we
are
and
how
little
likely
it
is
that
we
should
understand
why
certain
forms
are
fertile
and
other
forms
sterile
when
intercrossed
it
can,in
the
second
place
be
clearly
shown
that
mere
external
dissimilarity
between
two
species
does
not
determine
their
greater
or
lesser
de
gree
of
sterility
when
crossed
and
we
may
apply
the
same
rule
to
domestic
varieties
in
the
third
place,some
eminent
naturalists
believe
that
long
course
of
domesti
cation
tends
to
eliminate
sterility
in
the
successive
genera
tions
of
hybrids
which
were
at
first
only
slightly
sterile
and
if
this
be
so
we
surely
ought
not
to
expect
to
find
sterility
both
appearing
and
disappearing
under
nearly
the
same
conditions
of
life
lastly
and
this
seems
to
mo
the
most
important
consideration
new
races
of
animals
and
plants
are
produced
under

he
experimentised
on
five
forms

are
commonly
reputed

which
he
tested
by
the

by
reciprocal

he
found

fertile

one
of
these
five
varieties
when
used

yielded

hence
the

of
this

must
have
been
in
some
manner
and
in
some

modified

in

from
these
several
comsiderations

do
not
think
that
the
very

can
be
proved
to
be
of
universal
occurrence
or
to
form
fundamental

between

the
general
fertility
of
varieties
does
not
seem
to
me
sufficient
to
overthrow
the
view
which
have
taken
with
respect
to
the
very
%enetal
but
not
invariable
steril
ity
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
namely
that
it
is
not
special
endowment

is
incidental
on
slowly
acquired
modifications

especially
in
the
reproductive
systems
of
the

red
independently
of
their

of
the
question
of

the
off
spring
of
species
when
crossed
and
of
varieties
when
crossed
may
be
compared
in
several
other
giirtner
whose
strong
wish
was
to
draw
marked
line
of
distine
tion
%etween
species
and
varieties
could
find.very
few
and
as
it
seems
to
me
quite
unimportant
differences
be
tween
the
so-called
hybrid
offspring
of
species
and
the
so-called
mongrel
offspring
of
varieties
and
on
the
other
hand
they
agree
most
closely
in
very
many
im
portant
respects
shall
here
discuss
this
subject
with
extreme
brevity
the
most
important
distinction
is
that
in
the
first
gener
ation
mongrels
are
more
variable
than
hybrids
but
gért
ner
admits
that
hybrids
from
species
which
have
long
been
cultivated
are
often
variable
in
the
first
generation
and
have
myself
seen
striking
instances
of
this
fact
giirtner
further
admits
that
hybrids
between
very
closely
allied
species
are
more
variab{e
than
those
from
very
dis
tinet
s}\)ecies
and
this
shows
that
the
difference
in
the
de
ee
of
variability
graduates
away
when
mongrels
and
the
more
fertile
hybrids
are
propagated
for
several
gener
ations
an
extreme
amount
of
variability
in
their
oﬂ'spri.uﬁ
is
notorious
but
some
fow
cases
both
of
hybrids
an
mongrels
long
retaining
uniformity
of
character
could
be
given
the
variability
however
in
the
successive
gener
ations
of
mongrels
is
gerhaps
greater
than
in
hybrids
this
greater
varia
il{‘tﬁr
of
mongrels
than
of
hybrids
does
not
seem
to
me
at
all
surprising
for
the
parents
of
mongrels
are
varieties
and
mostigy
domestic
varieties
very
few
experiments
having
been
tried
on
natural
vari
omir
vitl
hybrids
and
mungrels
241
eties
and
this
implies
in
most
cases
that
there
has
been
re
cent
variability
and
therefore
we
might
expect
that
snch
variability
would
often
continue
and
be
superadded
to
that
arising
from
the
mere
act
of
crossing
the
slight
degree
of
variability
in
hybrids
from
the
first
cross
or
in
the
first
gen
eration
in
contrast
with
their
extreme
variability
in
the
succeeding
generations
is
curious
fact
and
deserves
atten
tion
for
it
bears
on
and
corroborates
the
view
which
have
taken
on
the
cause
of
ordinary
variability
namely
that
it
is
due
to
the
reproductive
system
being
eminently
sensitive
to
any
change
1n
the
conditions
of
life
being
thus
often
ren
dered
either
impotent
or
at
least
incapable
of
its
proper
function
of
progueing
offspring
identical
with
the
parent
form
now
hybrids
in
the
first
generation
are
descended
from
species
excluding
those
long
cultivated
which
have
not
had
their
reproductive
systems
in
any
way
affected
and
they
are
not
variable
but
hybrids
themselves
have
their
reproductive
systems
seriously
affected
and
their
descendants
are
highly
variable
but
to
return
to
our
comparison
of
mongrels
and
hy
brids
girtner
states
that
mongrels
are
more
liable
than
hybrids
to
revert
to
either
parent-form
but
this
if
it
be
true
is
certainly
only
difference
in
degree
girtner
fur
ther
insists
that
when
any
two
species
although
most
close
ly
allied
to
each
other
are
crossed
with
third
species
t{e
hybrids
are
widely
different
from
each
other
whereas
if
two
very
distinct
varieties
of
one
species
are
crossed
with
another
species
the
hybrids
do
not
differ
much
but
this
conclusion
as
far
as
can
make
out
is
founded
on
sin
gle
experiment
and
seems
directly
opposed
to
the
results
of
several
experiments
made
by
kolreuter
these
alone
are
the
unimportant
differences
which
girtner
is
able
to
point
out
between
hybrid
and
mongrel
plants
on
the
otﬁer
hand
the
resemblance
in
mongrels
and
in
hybrids
to
their
respective

b!‘idys
produced
from

ac
cording
to

the

laws
when
two
species
are

one
has
sometimes
prepotent
power

its
likeness
on
the

and
so
believe
it
to
be

variety
certainly
often
has
this
prepotent
power
over
another

resem%le
each

and
so
it
is
with
mongrels
from

both
hybrids
and
mongrels
can
be
reduced
to
either
pure
parent-form
by
repeated
crosges
in
successive
generations
with
either
parent
these
several
remarks
are
apparently
applicable
to
animals
but
the
subject
is
here
excessively
complicated
partly
owing
to
the
existence
of
secondary
sexual
charac
ters
but
more
especially
owing
to
prepotency
in
trans
mitting
likeness
running
more
strongly
in
one
sex
than
in
the
other
both
when
one
species
is
crossed

and
when
one
variety
is
crossed
with
another

for
instance
think
those
authors
are
right

main
tain
that
the
ass
has
prepotent
power
over
the
horse
so
that
both
the
mule
an(f
the
hinny
more
resemble
the
ass
than
the
horse
but
that
the
prepotency
runs
more
strongly
in
the
male-ass
than
in
the
female
so
that
the
mule
which
is
the
offspring
of
the
male-ass
and
mare
is
more
like
an
ass
than
is
the
hinny

is
the
offspring
of
the
female-ass

much
stress
has
been
laid
by
some
authors
on
the
su
posed
fact
that
mongrel

alone
are
born

of

it
can
be
shown
that
this

ing
to

to
be

the

ix
the
sixth
chapter
enumerated
the
chief
objections
which
might
be
justly
urged
against
the
views
maintained
in
this
vo%ume
most
of
them
have
now
been
discussed
one
namely
the
distinctness
of
specific
forms
and
their
not
being
blended
together
by
innumerable
transitional
links
is
very
obvious
difficulty
assigned
reasons
why
such
links
do
not
commonly
occur
at
the
present
day
under
the
circumstances
apparently
most
favourable
for
their
presence
namely
on
an
extensive
and
continuous
area
with
graduated
physical
conditions
endeavoured
to
show
that
the
life
of
each
species
depends
in
more
important
manner
on
the
ﬁsence
of
other
already
defined
organic
forms
than
on
climate
and
therefore
that
the
really
governing
conditions
of
life
do
not
graduate
awa
quite
insensibly
like
heat
or
moisture
lgendea.voure
also
to
show
that
intermediate
varieties
from
existing
in
lesser
numbers
than
the
forms
which
they
connect
will
generally
be
beaten
out
and
exterminated
during
the
course
of
further
modification
and
improvement
the
main
cause
however
of
innumerable
intermediate
links
not
now
occurring
everywhere
throughout
nature
depends
on
the
very
process
ofy
natural
selection
through
which
new
varieties
continually
take
the
places
of
and
extermi
nate
their
parent-forms
but
just
in
proportion
as
this
246
imperyection
of
the
onr
ix
process
of
extermination
has
acted
on
an
enormous
scale
80
must
the
number
of
intermediate
varieties
which
have
formerly
existed
on
the
earth
be
truly
enormous
why
then
is
not
every
geological
formation
and
every
stra
tum
full
of
such
intermediate
links
geology
assuredly
does
not
reveal
any
such
finely
graduated
organic
chain
and
this
berhaps
18
the
most
obvious
and
gravest
objec
tion
which
can
be
urged
against
my
theory
the
expla
nation
lies
as
believe
in
the
extreme
imperfection
of
the
geological
record
the
tirst
place
it
should
always
be
borne
in
mind
what
sort
of
intermediate
forms
must
on
my
theory
have
formerly
existed
have
found
it
difficult
when
looking
at
any
two
species
to
avoid
picturing
to
myself
forms
directly
intermediate
between
them
lfnt
this
is
wholly
false
view
we
should
always
look
for
forms
in
termediate
between
each
species
and
common
but
un
known
ﬁpro
enitor
and
the
progenitor
will
generally
have
diftered
in
some
respects
from
all
its
moﬁiﬁed
de
scendants
to
give
simple
illustration
the
fantail
and
pouter
pigeons
have
both
descended
from
the
rock-pigeon
if
we
possessed
all
the
intermediate
varieties
which
have
ever
existed
we
should
have
an
extremely
close
series
between
both
and
the
rock-pigeon
but
we
should
have
no
varieties
directly
intermediate
between
the
fantail
and
pouter
none
for
instance
combining
tail
somewhat
ex
}mnded
with
crop
somewhat
enlarged
the
characteristic
eatures
of
these
two
breeds
these
two
breeds
more
over
have
become
so
much
modified
that
if
we
had
no
historical
or
indirect
evidence
regarding
their
origin
it
would
not
have
been
possible
to
have
determined
fgz)m
mere
comparison
of
their
structure
with
that
of
the
rock
})igeon
whether
they
had
descended
from
this
species
or
rom
some
other
allied
species
such
as
c
oenas
so
with
natural
species
if
we
look
to
forms
very
dis
tinct
for
instance
to
the
horse
and
tapir
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
links
ever
existed
directly
interme
diate
between
them
but
between
each
and
an
unknown
sommon
parent
the
common
parent
will
have
had
in
its
whole
organisation
much
general
resemblance
to
the
omr
ix
geological
record
247
tapir
and
to
the
horse
but
in
some
points
of
structure
may
have
differed
considerably
from
both
even
perhaps
more
than
they
differ
from
each
other
hence
in
all
such
cases
we
should
be
unable
to
recognise
the
parent-form
of
any
two
or
more
species
even
if
we
closely
compared
the
structure
of
the
parent
with
that
of
its
modified
de
scendants
unless
at
the
same
time
we
had
nearly
per
fect
chain
of
the
intermediate
links
it
is
just
ible
by
my
theory
that
one
of
two
living
forms
might
have
descended
from
the
other
for
instance
horse
from
tapir
and
in
this
case
diérect
intermediate
links
will
have
existed
between
them
but
such
case
would
imply
that
one
form
had
remained
for
very
long
period
unaltered
whilst
its
descendants
had
undergone
vast
amount
of
c’hange
and
the
principle
of
competition
between
organism
and
organism
between
child
and
pa
rent
will
render
this
very
rare
event
for
in
all
cases
the
new
and
improved
forms
of
life
will
tend
to
supplant
the
old
and
unimproved
forms
by
the
theory
of
natural
selection
all
living
species
have
been
connected
with
the
parent-species
of
each
us
by
differences
not
greater
than
we
see
between
the
varieties
of
the
same
species
at
the
present
day
and
these
parent-species
now
generally
extinct
have
in
their
turn
been
similarly
connected
with
more
ancient
species
and
so
on
backwards
always
convergint%l
to
the
common
ancestor
of
each
great
class
so
that
the
number
of
in
termediate
and
transitional
links
between
all
living
and
extinct
species
must
have
been
inconceivably
feat
but

when

we
find
that

examine

him
remember
lyell’s
profound
remark
that
the

the

and

of

an

is

by

of

professor

has
given
me
the
maximum

in
most
cases
from
actual
measure
ment
in

cases
from
estimate
of

moreover
between

have
in
the
opinion
of
most
§eologists
enormously
long
blank
%erio
s
so
that
the
lofty
pile
of
sedimentary
rocks
in
ritain
gives
but
an
inadequate
idea
of
the

which
has
elapsed

their

must
have
consumed

esti
mated

by

of

this
estimate
may
be
quite
erroneous
yet
con
sidering
over
what
wide

fine

is
transported
by
the
currents
of
the

the
process
of
accumulation
in
any
one
area
must
be
extremely
slow
but
the
amount
of
denudation
which
the
strata
have
in
many
places
suffered
independently
of
the
rate
of
accumulation
of
the
degraded
matter
probably
offers
the
2530
imperfection
of
the
cmar
ix
best
evidence
of
the
lapse
of
time
remember
having
been
much
struck
with
the
evidence
of
denudation
when
viewing
volcanic
islands
which
have
been
worn
by
the
waves
and
pared
all
round
into
perpendicular
cliffs
of
one
or
two
thousand
feet
in
height
for
the
gentle
slope
of
the
lava-streams
due
to
their
formerly
liquig
state
showed
at
glance
how
far
the
hard
rocky
beds
had
once
extended
into
the
open
ocean
the
same
story
is
still
more
plainly
told
by
faults,—those
great
cracks
along
which
the
strata
have
been
upheaved
on
one
side
or
thrown
down
on
the
other
to
the
height
or
depth
of
thousands
of
feet
for
since
the
crust
cracked
the
surface
of
the
land
has
been
so
completely
planed
down
by
the
action
of
the
sea
that
no
trace
of
tiese
vast
dislocations
is
externally
visible
the
craven
fault
for
instance
extends
for
upwards
of
30
miles
and
along
this
line
the
vertical
displacement
of
the
strata
has
varied
from
600
to
8000
feet
prof
ram
say
has
published
an
account
of
downthrow
in

sea
of
2300
feet
and
he
informs
me
that
he
fully
believes
there
is
one
in
merionethshire
of
12,000
feet
yet
in
these
cases
there
is
nothing
on
the
surface
to
show
such
prodi
gious
movements
the
pile
of
rocks
on
the
one
or
other
side
having
been
smoothly
swept
away
the
considera
tion
of
these
facts
impresses
my
mind
almost
in
the
same
mauner
as
does
the
vain
endeavour
to
grapple
with
the
idea
of
eternity
am
tempted
to
give
one
other
case
the
well-known
one
of
the
denudation
of
the
weald
though
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
denudation
of
the
weald
has
been
mere
trifle
in
comparison
with
that
which
has
removed
masses
of
our
paleozoic
strata
in
parts
ten
thousand
feet
in
thickness
as
shown
in
prof
ramsay’s
masterly
memoir
on
this
subject
yet
it
is
an
admirable
lesson
to
stand
on
the
intermediate
hilly
country
and
look
on
the
one
hand
at
the
north
downs
and
on
the
other
hand
at
the
south
downs
for
remembering
that
at
no
great
distance
to
the
west
the
northern
and
soutﬁern
escarpments
meet
and
close
one
can
safel
rocks
which
must
gave
covered
up
the
weald
within
so
limited
period
as
since
the
latter
part
of
the
chalk
formation
the
distance
from
the
northern
to
the
south
picture
to
oneself
the
great
dome
of
omar
ix
geological
record
251
ern
downs
is
about
22
miles
and
the
thickness
of
the
several
formations
is
on
an
average
about
1100
feet
as
am
informed
by
prof
ramsay
but
if
as
some
geologists
suppose
range
of
older
rocks
underlies
the
weald
on
the
flanks
of
which
the
overlying
sedimentary
deposits
might
have
accumulated
in
thinner
masses
than
elsewhere
the
above
estimate
would
be
erroneous
but
this
source
of
doubt
probably
would
not
greatly
affect
the
estimate
as
applied
to
the
western
extremity
of
the
district
if
then
we
knew
the
rate
at
which
the
sea
commonly
wears
away
line
of
cliff
of
any
given
height
we
could
measure
the
time
requisite
to
have
denuded
the
weald
this
of
course
cannot
be
done
but
we
may
in
order
to
form
some
crude
notion
on
the
subject
assume
that
the
sea
would
eat
into
cliffs
500
feet
in
height
at
the
rate
of
one
inch
in
century
this
will
at
first
appear
much
too
small
an
allowance
but
it
is
the
same
as
if
we
were
to
assume
cliff
one
yard
in
height
to
be
eaten
back
along
whole
line
of
coast
at
the
rate
of
one
yard
in
nearly
every
twenty-two
years
doubt
whether
any
rock
even
as
soft
as
chalk
would
yield
at
this
rate
excepting
on
the
most
exposed
coasts
though
no
doubt
the
degradation
of
lofty
cliff
would
be
much
more
rapid
from
the
breakage
of
the
fallen
fragments
on
the
other
hand
do
not
be
lieve
that
any
line
of
coast
ten
or
twenty
miles
in
lenﬁth
ever
suffers
degradation
at
the
same
time
along
its
whole
indented
length
and
we
must
remember
that
almost
all
strata
contain
harder
layers
or
nodules
which
from
long
re
sisting
attrition
form
breakwater
at
the
base
we
may
at
least
confidently
believe
that
no
rocky
coast
500
feet
in
height
commonly
yields
at
the
rate
of
foot
per
century
for
this
would
be
t{xe
same
in
amount
as
clif}
one
yard
in
height
retreating
twelve
yards
in
twenty-two
years
and
10
one
think
who
has
carefully
observed
the
shape
of
old
fallen
fragments
at
the
base
of
cliffs
will
admit
any
near
approach
to
such
rapid
wearing
away
hence
un
der
ordinary
circumstances
should
infer
that
for
cliff
500
feet
in
height
denudation
of
one
inch
per
century
for
the
whole
length
would
be
sufficient
allowance
at
this
rate
on
the

the

confess
that

shows
that
have

not
sufficiently

the

the
circumstance
of

the

the

that

no

we
are

taking

erroneous

when
we
tacitly
admit
to
ourselves
that
sediment
is
being
deposited
over
nearly
the
whole
bed
of
the

at

sufficiently
quick
to

without
the

in

any

seem
explicable
only
on
the

of

not

lying
for

in

the

not

ith
respect

it
is

to

belonging
to

vast

with
one
exception
discovered
by
sir
c
lyell
in
the
carboniferous
strata
of
north
america
in
regard
to
mammiferous
remains
single
glance
at
the
historical
table
published
in
the
suppiement
to
lyell’s
manual
will
bring
home
the
truth
how
accidental
and
rare
is
their
preservation
far
better
than
pages
of
detail
nor
is
their
rarity
surprising
when
we
remember
how
large
propor
tion
of
the
bones
of
tertiary
mammals
have
been
dis
covered
either
in
caves
or
in
lacustrine
deposits
and
that
not
cave
or
true
lacustrine
bed
is
known
belonging
to
the
age
of
our
secondary
or
pal@ozoic
formations
but
the
imperfection
in
the
geological
record
mainly
results
from
another
and
more
important
cause
than
any
of
the
foregoing
namely
from
the
several
formations
being
separated
from
each
other
by
wide
intervals
of
time
when
we
see
the
formations
tabulated
in
written
works
or
when
we
follow
them
in
nature
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
believing
that
they
are
closely
comsecutive
but
we
know
for
instance
from
sir
r
i[urchison’s
great
work
on
russia
what
wide
fgaps
there
are
in
that
country
between
the
superimposed
formations
so
it
is
in
north
america
and
in
many
other
parts
of
the
world
the
most
skilful
geologist
if
his
attention
had
been
exclusively
confined
to
these
large
territories
would
never
have
suspected
that
during
the
periods
which
were
blank
and
barren
in
his
own
country
great
piles
of
sediment
charged
with
new
and
peculiar
forms
of
life
had
elsewhere
been
accumulated
and
if
in
each
separate
territory
hardly
any
idea
can
be
formed
of
the
length
of
time
which
has
elapsed
between
the
consecutive
formations
we
may
infer
that
this
could
nowhere
be
ascertained
the
frequent
and
great
changes
in
the
mineralogical
composition
of
consecutive
formations
generally
implying
great
changes
in
the
eeo%'aphy
of
the
surrounding
lands
whence
the
sediment
has
been
derived
accords
with
the
belief
of
vast
intervals
of
time
having
elapsed
between
each
formation
but
we
can
think
see
why
the
geological
formations
of
each
region
are
almost
invariably
intcrmittent
that
is
have
not
followed
each
other
in
close
sequence
scarcely

eecord

any
fact
struck
me
more
when
examining
many
hundred
miles
of
the
south
american
coasts
which
have
been
up
raised
several
hundred
feet
within
the
recent
period
than
the
absence
of
any
recent
deposits
sufficiently
extensive
to
last
for
even
a_short
geological
period
along
the
whole
west
coast
which
is
inhabited
by
peculiar
marine
fauna
tertiary
beds
are
so
scantily
developed
that
no
record
of
several
successive
and
peculiar
marine
faunas
will
probably
be
preserved
to
distant
age
little
re
flection
will
explain
why
along
the
rising
coast
of
the
western
side
of
south
america
no
extensive
formations
with
recent
or
tertiary
remains
can
anywhere
be
found
though
the
supply
of
sediment
must
for
ages
have
been
great
from
the
enormous
degradation
of
the
coast-rocks
and
from
muddy
streams
entering
the
sea
the
explana
tion
no
doubt
is
that
the
littoral
and
sub-littoral
deposits
are
continually
worn
away
as
soon
as
they
are
brought
up
by
the
slow
and
gradual
rising
of
the
land
within
the
grinding
action
of
the
coast-waves
we
may
think
safely
conclude
that
sediment
must
be
accumulated
in
extremely
thick
solid
or
extensive
masses
in
order
to
withstand
the
incessant
action
of
the
waves
when
first
upraised
and
during
subsequent
oscilla
tions
of
level
suc%
thick
and
extensive
accumulations
of
sediment
may
be
formed
in
two
ways
either
in
pro
found
depths
of
the
sea
in
which
case
judging
from
the
researches
of
e
forbes
we
may
conclude
that
the
bottom
will
be
inhabited
by
extremely
few
animals
and
the
mass
when
upraised
will
give
most
imperfect
record
of
the
forms
of
life
which
then
existed
or
sediment
may
be
ac
cumulated
to
any
thickness
and
extent
over
shallow
bottom
if
it
continue
slowly
to
subside
in
this
latter
case
as
long
as
the
rate
of
subsidence
and
supply
of
sed
iment

each

the

will
remain

for
life
and
thus
fossiliferous
forma
tion
thick
enough
when
upraised
to
resist
any
amount
of
degradation
may
be
formed
am
convinced
that
all
our
ancient
formations
which
are
rich
in
fossils
have
thus
been
formed
during
subsi

of

have
watched
the
progress
of

have
been
surprised
to
note
how
author
after
author
in
treating
of
this
or
that
great
formation
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
accumulated
during
subsidence
may
add
that
the
only
ancient
tertiary
formation
on
the
west
coast
of
south
america
which
has
been
bulky
enough
to
resist
such
degradation
as
it
has
as
yet
suffered
but
which
will
hardly
last
to
distant
geological
age
was
certainly
de
posited
during
downward
oscillation
of
level
and
thus
gained
considerable
thickness
all
geological
facts
tell
us
flainly
that
each
area
has
undergone
numerous
slow
oscillations
of
level
and
appar
ently
these
oscillations
have
affected
wide
spaces
con
se%uently
formations
rich
in
fossils
and
sufficiently
thick
and
extensive
to
resist
subsequent
degradation
may
have
been
formed
over
wide
spaces
during
periods
of
subsi
dence
but
only
where
the
supply
of
set?iment
was
suffi
cient
to
keep
the
sea
shallow
and
to
embed
and
preserve
the
remains
before
they
had
time
to
decay
on
the
other
hand
as
long
as
the
bed
of
the
sea
remained
stationary
thick
deposits
could
not
have
been
accumulated
in
the
shallow
parts
which
are
the
most
favourable
to
life
8till
less
could
this
have
happened
during
the
alternate
eriods
of
elevation
or
to
speak
more
accurately
the
eds
which
were
then
accumulated
will
have
been
de
stroyed
by
being
upraised
and
brought
within
the
limits
of
the
coast-action
thus
the
geological
record
will
almost
necessarily
be
rendered
intermittent
feel
much
confidence
in
the
truth
of
these
views
for
they
are
in
strict
accordance
with
the
general
principles
inculcated
by
sir
c
lyell
and
e
forbes
independently
arrived
at
similar
conclusion
one
remark
is
here
worth
passing
notice
during
eriods
of
elevation
the
area
of
the
land
and
of
the
adjoin
shoal
parts
of
the

will
be
increased
and
new
sta
tions
will
often
be
formed
all
circumstances
most
fa
vourable
as
previously
explained
for
the
formation
of
new
varieties
and
species
eut
during
such
periods
there
will
generally
be

decrease
excepting
the

on

when

broken
up
into
an

and
consequently
during
subsi
dence
though
there
will
be
much
extinction
fewer
new
varieties
or
species
will
be
formed
and
it
is
during
these
very
periods
of
subsidence
that
our
great
deposits
rich
in
fossils
have
been
accumulated
nature
may
almost
be
said
to
have
guarded
against
the
frequent
giscovery
of
her
transitional
or
linking
forms
from
the
foregoing
considerations
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
the
geological
record
viewed
as
whole
is
extremely
imperfect
but
if
we
confine
our
attention
to
any
one
formation
it
becomes
more
difficult
to
understand
why
we
do
not
therein
find
closely
graduated
varieties
between
the
allied
species
which
lived
at
its
commencement
and
at
its
close
some
cases
are
on
record
of
the
same
species
presenting
distinet
varieties
in
the
upper
and
lower
parts
of
the
same
formation
but
as
they
are
rare
they
may
be
here
passed
over
although
each
formation
has
indis
utably
required
vast
number
of
years
for
its
deposition
can
see
several
reasons
why
each
should
not
include
aduated
series
of
links
between
the
species
which
then
ived
but
can
by
no
means
pretend
to
assign
due
pro
portional
weight
to
the
following
considerations
although
each
formation
may
mark
very
long
lapse
of
years
each
perhaps
is
short
compared
with
the
period
requisite
to
change
one
species
into
another
am
aware
that
two
palmontologists
whose
opinions
are
worthy
of
much
deference
namely
bronn
and
woodward
have
con
cluded
that
the
average
duration
of
each
formation
is
twice
or
thrice
as
long
as
the
average
duration
of
specific
forms
but
insuperable
difficulties
as
it
seems
fo
me
revent
us
coming
to
any
just
conclusion
on
this
head
hen
we
see
species
first
appearing
in
the
middle
of
any
formation
it
would
be
rash
in
the
extreme
to
infer
that
it
had
not
elsewhere
previously
existed
so
again
when
we
find
species
disagpearing
before
the
uppermost
layers
have
been
deposited
it
would
be
equally
rash
to
suppose
that
it
then
became
wholly
extinct
we
forget
how

of
europe
is

imperfection
of

nor
have
the
several
stages
of
the

formation
through

europe
been
correlated
with
perfect
accuracy
with
marine
animals
of
all
kinds
we
may
safely
infer
large
amount
of
migration
during
climatal
and
other
changes
and
when
we
see
sgecies
first
appearing
in
an
formation
the
probability
is
that
it
only
then
first
immi
grated
into
that
area
it
is
well
known
for
instance
that
several
sﬁeciea
appeared
somewhat
earlier
in
the
paleozoic
beds
of
north
xmerica
than
in
those
of
europe
time
having
apparently
been
required
for
their
migration
from
the
american
to
the
european
seas
in
examining
the
latest
deposits
of
various
quarters
of
the
world
it
has
everywhere
been
noted
that
some
few
still
existing
spe
cies
are
common
in
the
deposit
but
have
become
extinct
in
the
immediately
surrounding
sea
or
conversely
that
some
are
now
abundant
in
the
neighbouring
sea
but
are
rare
or
absent
in
this
particular
deposit
it
is
an
excel
®lent
lesson
to
reflect
on
the
ascertained
amount
of
migra
tion
of
the
inhabitants
of
europe
during
the
glacial
period
which
forms
only
part
of
one
whole
geological
period
and
likewise
to
reflect
on
the
great
changes
of
level

the
inordinately
great
change
of
climate
on
the
pro
digious
lapee
of
time
all
included
within
this

gla

period
yet
it
may
be
doubted
whether
in
any
quarter
of
the
world
sedimentary
deposits
including
fossil
remains
have
gone
on
accumnlating
within
the
same
area
during
the
whole
of
this
period
it
is
not
for
instance
probable
that
sediment
was
deposited
ildg
the
whole
of
the
glacial
period
near
the
mouth
of
the
missis
sippi
within
that
limit
of
depth
at
which
marine
animals
can
flourish
for
we
know
what
vast
geographical
changes
occurred
in
other
parts
of

of
time
when
such

as
were
deposited

to

that

had
been
less
than
that
of
the

period
instead
of
having
been
really
far
greater
that
is
extending
from
be
fore
the
glacial
epoch
to
the
present
day
in
order
to
get
perfect
gradation
between
two
forms
in
the
upper
and
lower
parts
of
the
same
formation
the
deposit
must
have
lgone
on
accumulating
for
very
long
period
in
order
to
have
given
sufficient
time
for
the
slow
process
of
variation
hence
the
deposit
will
generally
have
to
be
very
thick
one
and
the
species
undergoing
modi
fication
will
have
had
to
live
on
the
same
area
throughout
this
whole
time
but
we
have
seen
that
thick
fossil
iferous
formation
can
only
be
accumulated
during
period
of
subsidence
and
to
keep
the
depth
approximately
the
same
which
is
necessary
in
order
to
euabf:z
the

spe
cies
to
live
on
the

space
the
supply
of
sediment
must
nearly
have
counterbalanced
the
amount
of
subsidence
but
this
same
movement
of
subsidence
will
often
tend
to
sink
the
area
whence
the
sediment
is
derived
and
thus
diminish
the
supply
whilst
the
downward
movement
con
tinues
in
fact
this
nearly
exact
balancing
between
the
supply
of
sediment
and
the
amount
of
subsidence
is
prob
abe
rare
contingency
for
it
has
been
observed
by
more
than
one
palmontologist
that
very
thick
deposits
are
usually
barren
of
organic
remains
except
near
their
upper
or
lower
limits
it
would
seem
that
each
separate
formation
like
the
whole
pile
of
formations
in
any
country
has
generally
been
intermittent
in
its
accumulation
when
we
see
as
is
so
often
the
case
formation
composed
of
beds
of
different
mineralogical
composition
we
may
reasonably
suspect
that
the
process
of

has
been
much
intemfpted
as
change
in
the
currents
of
the
sea
and
sugply
of
sed
iment
of
different
nature
will
generally
have
been
due
to
eographical
changes
requiring
much
time
nor
will
the
closest
inspection
of
formation
give
any
idea
of
the
time
which
its
deposition
has
consumed
many
in
stances
could
he
given
of
beds
only
few
feet
in
thickness
representing
formations
elsewhere
thousands
of
feet
in
thickness
and
which
must
have
required
an
enormous
period
foxi
2t}‘leir
accumulation
yet
no
one
ignorant
of
this
260
imperfection
of
the
cmas
tx
fact
would
have
suspected
the
vast
lapse
of
time
represent
ed
by
the
thinner
formation
many
cases
could
be
given
of
the
lower
beds
of
formation
having
been
upraised
denuded
submerged
and
then
re-covered
by
the
upper
beds
of
the
same
formation,—facts
showing
what
wide
yet
easily
overlooked
intervals
have
occurred
in
its
accu
mulation
in
other
cases
we
have
the
plainest
evidence
in
great
fossilised
trees
still
standing
upright
as
they
ew
of
many
long
intervals
of
time
and
changes
of
level
uring
the
process
of
deposition
which
would
never
even
have
been
suspected
haso
not
the
trces
chanced
to
have
been
preserved
thus
messrs
lyell
and
dawson
found
carboniferous
beds
1400
feet
thick
in
nova
scotia
with
ancient
root-bearing
strata
one
above
the
other
at
no
less
than
sixty-eight
different
levels
hence
when
the
same
species
occur
at
the
bottom
middle
and
top
of
forma
tion
the
probability
is
that
they
have
not
lived
on
the
same
spot
during
the
whole
period
of
deposition
but
have
disappeared
and
reappeared
perhaps
many
times
during
the
same
geological
period
so
that
if
such
species
were
to
undergo
considerable
amount
of
modification
during
any
one
qleological
period
section
would
not
probably
include
all
the
fine
intermediate
gradations
which
must
on
my
theory
have
existed
between
them
but
abrupt
though
perhaps
very
slight
changes
of
form
it
is
all-important
to
remember
that
naturalists
have
no
golden
rule
by
which
to
distinguish
species
and
varie
ties
they
grant
some
little
variability
to
each
species
but
when
they
meet
with
somewhat
greater
amount
of
difference
between
any
two
forms
they
rank
both
as
species
unless
they
are
enabled
to
connect
them
together
by
close
intermediate
gradations
and
this
from
the
reasons
iiusi
assigned
we
can
seldom
hope
to
effect
in
any
one
geological
section
supposing
and
to
be
two
species
and
third
a
to
be
found
in
an
underlying
bed
even
if
were
strictly
intermediate
between
and
c
it
would
simply
be
ranked
as
third
and
distinct
species
unless
at
tlie
same
time
it
could
be
most
closely
connected
with
either
one
or
both
forms
by
intermediate
varieties
nor
should
it
be
forgotten
as
before
explained
that

might
be
the
actual
progenitor
of

c
and
yet
might
notg
at
all
necessnrify
e:n;tricﬂy
intermediateybetwgl;n
them
in
all
points
of
structure
so
that
we
might
obtain
the
parent-species
and
its
several
modified
descendants
from
the
lower
and
upper
beds
of
formation
and
unless
we
obtained
numerous
transitional
gradations
we
should
not
recognise
their
relationship
and
should
consequently
be
compelled
to
rank
them
all
as
distinct
species
it
is
notorious
on
what
excessively
slight
differences
many
pal@ontologists
have
founded
their
species
and
they
do
this
the
more
readily
if
the
specimens
come
from
different
sub-stages
of
the
same
formation
some
ex
erienced
conchol
og‘sts
are
now
sinking
many
of
the
very
ne
species
of
d’orbigny
and
others
into
the
rank
of
varieties
and
on
this
view
we
do
find
the
kind
of
evi
dence
of
change
which
on
my
theory
we
ought
to
find
moreover
if
we
look
to
rather
wide
intervals
namely
the
distinet
but
consecutive
stages
of
the
same
great
forma
tion
we
find
that
the
embedded
fossils
though
almost
universally
ranked
as
specifically
different
yet
are
fan
more
closely
allied
to
each
other
than
are
the
species
found
in
more
widely
separated
formations
but
to
this
subject
shall
have
to
return
in
the
following
chapter
one.ather
consideration
is
worth
notice
with
animalg
and
plants
that
can
propagate
rapidly
and
are
not
highly
locomotive
there
is
reason
to
suspect
as
we
have
former
ly
seen
that
their
varieties
are
generally
at
first
local
and
that
such
local
varieties
do
not
spread
widely
and
supplant
their
parent-forms
until
théy
have
been
modified
and
perfected
in
some
considerable
degree
according
to
this
view
the
chance
of
discovering
in
formation
in
any
one
country
all
the
early
stages
of
transition
between
any
two
forms
is
small
for
the
successive
changes
are
supposed
to
have
been
local
or
confined
to
some
one
spot
most
marine
animals
have
wide
range
and
we
have
seen
that
with
plants
it
is
those
which
have
the
widest
range
that
oftenest
present
varieties
go
that
with
shells
and
other
marine
animsls
it
is
probably
those
which
have
had
the
widest
range
far
exceeding
the
limits
of
the
known
geological
formations
of
europe
which
have
often
209
imperfection
of
the
cmar
ix
est
given
rise
first
to
local
varieties
and
ultimately
to
new
species
and
this
again
would
greatly
leseen
the
chance
of
our
being
able
to
trace
the
stages
of
transition
in
any
one
feological
formation
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
at
the
present
day
with
perfect
specimens
for
examination
two
forms
can
sel
dom
be
connected
by
intermediate
varieties
and
thus
roved
to
be
the
same
species
until
many
specimens
have
eeeu
collected
from
many
places
and
in
the
case
of
fossil
species
this
could
rarely
be
effected
by
palsontologists
we
shall
perhaps
best
perceive
the
improbability
of
our
being
enabled
to
connect
species
by
numerous
fine
inter
mediate
fossil
links,.by
asking
ourselves
whether
for
in
stance
geologists
at
some
future
period
will
be
able
to
prove
that
our
different
breeds
of
cattle
sheep
horses
and
dogs
have
descended
from
single
stock
or
from
sev
eral
aboriginal
stocks
or
again
whether
certain
sea
shells
inhabiting
the
shores
of
north
america
which
are
ranked
by
some
conchologists
as
distinct
species
from
their
european
representatives
and
by
other
conchologists
as
only
varieties
are
really
varieties
or
are
as
it
is
called
specifically
distinct
tzis
could
be
effected
only
by
the
future
ogist
discovering
in
fossil
state
numerous
in
termediate
gradations
and
such
success
seems
to
me
im
probable
in
the
highest-degree
geological
research
though
it
has
added
numerous
species
to
existing
and
extinct
genera
and
has
made
the
intervals
between
some
few
groups
less
wide
than
they
otherwise
would
have
been
yet
has
done
scarcely
anything
in
breaking
down
the
distinction
between
species
by
con
necting
them
together
by
numerous
fine
intermediate
varieties
and
this
not
having
been
effected
is
probably
the
gravest
and
most
obvious
of
all
the
many
objections
which
may
be
urged
against
my
views
hence
it
will
be
worth
while
to
sum
up
the
fore;%oing
remarks
under
an
imaginary
illustration
the
malay
achipelago
is
of
about
the
size
of
europe
from
the
north
cape
to
the
mediterranean
and
from
britain
to
russia
and
therefore
equals
all
the
geological
formations
which
may
have
been
examined
with
any
accuracy
excepting
those
of
the
united
cmr
ix
geological
record
263
states
of
america
fully
agree
with
mr
godwin-aus
ten
that
the
present
condition
of
the
malay
archipelago
with
its
numerous
large
islands
separated
by
wide
and
shallow
seas
probably
represents
the
former
state
of
europe
when
most
of
our
formations
were
accumulating
the
malay
archipelago
is
one
of
the
richest
regions
of
the
whole
world
in
organic
beings
yet
if
all
the
species
were
to
be
collected
which
have
ever
lived
there
how
imperfectly
would
they
represent
the
natural
history
of
the
world{
but
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
terres
trial
productions
of
the
archipelago
would
be
preserved
in
an
excessively
imperfect
manner
in
the
formations
which
we
suppose
to
}{)e
there
accumulating
suspect
that
not
many
of
the
strictly
littoral
animals
or
of
those
which
lived
on
naked
submarine
rocks
would
be
em
bedded
and
those
embedded
in
gravel
or
sand
would
not
endure
to
distant
epoch
herever
sediment
did
not
accumulate
on
the
bed
of
the
sea
or
where
it
did
not
accumulate
at
sufficient
rate
to
protect
organic
bodies
from
decay
no
remains
could
be
preserved
in
our
archipelago
believe
that
fossiliferous
forma
tions
could
be
formed
of
sufficient
thickness
to
last
to
an
age
as
distant
in
futurity
as
the
secondary
formations
lie
in
the
past
only
during
l;)eriods
of
subsidence
these
eriods
of
subsidence
would
be
separated
from
each
other
enormous
intervals
during
which
the
area
would
be
either
stationary
or
rising
whilst
rising
each
fossiliferous
formation
would
be
destroyed
almost
as
soon
as
accumu
lated
by
the
incessant
coast-action
as
we
now
see
on
the
shores
of
south
america
during
the
periods
of
subsi
dence
there
would
probably
be
much
extinction
of
life
during
the
periods
of
elevation
there
would
be
much
variation
but
the
geological
record
would
then
be
least
erfect
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
duration
of
any
one
great
period
of
subsidence
over
the
whole
or
part
of
the
archipelago
together
with
contemporaneous
accumula
tion
of
se§iment
would
exceed
the
average
duration
of
the
same
specific
forms
and
these
contingencies
are
indis
964
imperfection
of
the
omar
1x
pensable
for-the
preservation
of
all
the
transitional
tions
between
any
two
or
more
species
if
such
grada
tions
were
not
fully
preserved
transitional
varieties
would
merely
appear
as
so
many
distinct
species
it
is
also
probable
that
each
ll?'ea.t
period
of
gubsidence
would
be
interrupted
by
oscillations
of
level
and
that
slight
cli
matal
ch
would
intervene
during
such
iength
periods
and
in
these
cases
the
inhabitants
of
the
archi
pelago
would
have
to
migrate
and
no
closely
consecutive
record
of
their
modifications
could
be
preserved
in
any
one
formation
very
many
of
the
marine
inhabitants
of
the
archipe
lago
now
range
thousands
of
miles
beyond
its
confines
and
analogy
leads
me
to
believe
that
it
would
be
chiefly
these
far-ranging
species
which
would
oftenest
produce
new
varieties
and
the
varieties
would
at
first
generally
be
local
or
confined
to
one
place
but
if
possessed
of
any
decided
advantage
or
when
further
modified
and
im
proved
they
would
slowly
spread
and
supplant
their
parent-forms
when
such
varieties
returned
to
their
ancient
homes
as
they
would
differ
from
their
former
state
in
nearly
uniform
though
perhaps
extremel
slight
degree
they
would
according
to
the
principles
fol
lowed
by
many
paleontologists
be
mnke(f
as
new
and
distinet
species
if
then
there
be
some
degree
of
truth
in
these
re
marks
we
have
no
right
to
expect
to
find
in
our
geologi
cal
formations
an
infinite
number
of
those
fine
transitional
forms
which
on
my
theory
assuredly
have
connected
all
the
past
and
present
species
of
the
same
group
into
ome
long
and
branching
chain
of
life
we
ought
only
to
look
for
few
links
some
more
closely
some
more
distantly
related
to
each
other
and
these
{inks
let
them
be
ever
8o
close
if
found
in
different
stages
of
the
same
formation
would
by
most
paleontologists
be
ranked
as
distinct
species
but
do
not
pretend
that
should
ever
have
suspected
how
poor
record
of
the
mutations
of
life
the
best
preserved
geological
section
presented
had
not
the
difficulty
of
our
not
discovering
innumerable
trangitional
links
between
the
species
which
appeared
at
the

caur

record
205
mencement
and
close
of
each

pressed
so
hardly
on
my
theory
on
the
sudden
appearance
of
whole
grou\fu
of
allied
ies.—the
abrupt
manner
1{
which
whole
g{oups
of
species
suddenl
f:spear
in
certain
formations
has
been
urged
by
several
paleontologists
for
instance
by
agassiz
pictet
and
by
none
more
forcibly
than
by
professor
sedgwick
as
fatal
objection
to
the
belief
in
the
trans
mautation
of
species
numerous
species
belonging
to
the
same
genera
or
families
have
really
started
into
life
all
at
once
the
fact
would
be
fatal
to
the
theory
of
de
scent
with
slow
modification
through
natural
selection
_for
the
develg‘fment
of
a
group
of
forms
all
of
which
have
descended
from
some
one
progenitor
must
have
been
an
extremely
slow
process
and
the
progenitors
must
have
lived
long
ages
sefore
their

but
we
continually
over-rate
the
perfection
of
the
geological
record
and
falsely
infer
because
certain
genera
or
families
have
not
been
found
within
certain
stage
that
they
did
not
exist
before
that
stage
we
continually
forget
how
large
the
world
is
compared
with
the
area
over
which
our
geological
formations
have
been
carefully
examined
we
forget
that
groups
of
species
may
elsewhere
have
long
existed
and
have
slowly
multiplied
before
they
invaded
the
ancient
archipelagoes
of
europe
and
of
the
united
states
we
do
not
make
due
allowance
for
the
enormous
intervals
of
time
which
have
probably
elapsed
between
our
consecutive
formations,—longer
perhaps
in
some
cases
than
the
time
required
for
the
accumulation
of
each
formation
these
intervals
will
have
given
time
for
the
multiplication
of
species
from
some
one
or
some
few
parent-forms
and
in
the
succeeding
formation
such
spe

will
appear
as
if

recall
remark
formerly
made
namely
that
it

require
long

of

to
adapt
an

to
some
new
and
peculiar

for
in

to

of
species
have

been
pro
duced
imay
recall
the
well-known
fact
that
in
geological
treatises
published
not
many
years
ago
the
great
class
of
mammals
was
always
spoken
of
as
having
abruptly
come
in
at
the
commencement
of
the
tertiary
series
and
now
one
of
the
richest
known
accumulations
of
fossil
mammals
for
its
thickness
belongs
to
the
middle
of
the
secondary
series
and
one
true
mammal
has
been
discovered
in
the
new
red
sandstone
at
nearly
the
commencement
of
this
great
series
cuvier
used
to
urge
that
no
monkey
oc
curred
in
any
tertiary
stratum
but
now
extinct
species
have
been
discovered
in
india
south
america
and
in
europe
even
as
far
back
as
the
eocene
stage
had
it
not
been
for
the
rare
accident
of
the
preservation
of
footsteps
in
the
new
red
sandstone
of
the
t})nited
states
who
would
have
ventured
to
suppose
that
besides
reptiles
no
less
than
at
least
thirty
kinds
of
birds
some
of
gigantic
size
existed
during
that
period
not
fragment
of
bone
has
been
discovered
in
these
beds
notwithstanding
that
the
number
of
joints
shown
in
the
fossil
impressions
cor
respond
with
the
number
in
the
several
toes
of
living
birds
feet
some
authors
doubt
whether
the
animals
which
left
the
impressions
were
really
birds
until
quite
recently
these
authors
might
have
maintained
and
some
have
maintained
that
the
whole
class
of
birds
came
suddenly
into
existence
duriu&l
an
early
tertiary
period
but
now
we
know
on
the
authority
of
professor
owen
as
may
be
seen
in
lyell’s
manual
that
bird
certainly
lived
dur
ing
the
deposition
of
the
upper
green-sand
may
give
another
instance
which
from
having
passed
under
my
own
eyes
has
much
struck
me
in
memoir
on
fossil
sessile
cirripedes
have
stated
that
from
the
number
of
existing
and
extinct
tertiary
species
from
the
extraordinary
abundance
of
the
individuals
of
many
ssle
cies
all
over
the
world
from
the
arctic
regions
to
the
omr
ix
geological
eecord
267
uator
inhabiting
various
zones
of
depths
from
the
upper
tidal
limits
to
50
fathoms
from
the
perfect
manner
in
which
specimens
are
preserved
in
the
oldest
tertiary
beds
from
the
ease
with
which
even
fragment
of
valve
can
be
recognised
from
all
these
circumstances
inferred
that
had
sessile
cirripedes
existed
during
the
sec
ondary
periods
they
would
certainly
have
been
preserved
and
discovered
and
as
not
one
species
has
%een
dis
covered
in
beds
of
this
age
concluded
that
this
great
group
had
been
suddenly
developed
at
the
commencement
of
the
tertiary
series
this
was
sore
trouble
to
me
adding
as
thought
one
more
instance
of
the
abrupt
ap
eeamnce
of
great
group
of
species
but
my
work
had
ardly
been
published
when
skilful
palsontologist
m
bosquet
sent
me
drawing
of
perfect
specimen
of
an
unmistakeable
sessile
cirripede
which
he
had
himself
ex
tracted
from
the
chalk
of
belgium
and
as
if
to
make
the
case
as
striking
as
possible
this
sessile
cirripede
was
chthamalus
very
common
large
and
ubiquitous
genus
of
which
not
one
specimen
has
as
yet
been
found
even
in
any
tertiary
stratum
hence
we
now
positively
know
that
sessile
cirripedes
existed
during
the
secondary
period
and
these
cirripedes
might
have
been
the
pro
genitors
of
our
many
tertiary
and
existing
species
the
case
most
frequently
insisted
on
by
paleontolo
gists
of
the
apparently
su(f(,ien
appearance
of
whole
group
of
species
is
that
of
the
teleostean
fishes
low
down
the
chalk
period
this
group
includes
the
large
ma
jority
of
existing
species
lately
professor
pictet
has
carried
their
existence
one
sub-stage
further
back
and
some
palzontologists
believe
that
certain
much
older
fishes
of
which
the
affinities
are
as
yet
imperfectly
known
are
really
teleostean
assuming
however
that
the
whole
of
them
did
appear
as
agassiz
believes
at
the
commencement
of
the
chalk
formation
the
fact
would
certainly
be
highly
remarkable
but
cannot
see
that
it
would
be
an
insuperable
difficulty
on
my
theory
unless
it
could
likewise
be
shown
that
the
species
of
this
group
appeared
suddenly
and
simultaneously
throughout
the
world
at
this
same
period
it
is
almost
superfluous
to
268
imperfection
of
the
{omr
ix
remark
that
hardly
any
fossil-fish
are
known
from
south
of
the
equator
and
by
running
through
pictet’s
paleon
tology
it
will
be
seen
that
very
few
sg)ecies
are
known
from
several
formations
in
europe
some
few
families
of
fish
now
have
confined
range
the
teleostean
fish
might
formerly
have
had
similarly
confined
range
and
after
having
been
la.rﬁely
develoﬁed
in
some
one
ses
might
have
spread
widely
nor
have
we
any
right
to
suppose
that
the
seas
of
the
world
have
always
been
so
freely
open
from
north
to
south
as
they
are
at
present
even
at
this
day
if
the
malay
archipelago
were
con
verted
into
land
the
tropical
parts
of
tﬂe
dian
ocean
would
form
large
and
perfectly
enclosed
basin
in
which
any
group
of
marine
animals
might
be
multiplied
here
they
would
remain
confined
until
some
of
the
sgecies
became
adapted
to
cooler
climate
and
were
en
abled
to
double
the
southern
capes
of
africa
or
australia
and
thus
reach
other
and
distant
seas
from
these
and
similar
considerations
but
chiefly
from
our
ignorance
of
the
geology
of
other
countries
be
yond
the
confines
of
europe
and
the
united
states
and
from
the
revolution
in
our
palseontological
ideas
on
many
eointa
which
the
discoveries
of
even
the
last
dozen
years
ave
effected
it
seems
to
me
to
be
about
as
rash
in
us
to
dogmatize
on
the
succession
of
organic
beings
throughout
the
world
as
it
would
be
for
naturalist
to
land
for
five
minutes
on
some
one
barren
point
in
australia
and
then
to
discuss
the
number
and
range
of
its
productions
on
the
sudden
arance
of
groups
of
allied
species
in
the
lowest
known%fsﬂi
erw{
strata.—there
is
another
and
allied
difficulty
which
is
much
graver
allude
to
the
manner
in
which
numbers
of
species
of
the
same
group
suddenly
appear
in
the
lowest
known
fossiliferous
rocks
most
of
the
arguments
which
have
convinced
me
that
all
the
existing
species
of
the
same
group
have
descended
from
one
progenitor
apply
with
nearl%
equal
force
to
the
earliest
known
species
kor
instance
cannot
doubt
that
all
the
silurian
trilobites
have
descended
from
some
one
crustacean
which
must
have
lived
long
before
the
silu
our
ix
geological
record
269
rian
age
and
which
probably
differed
greatly
from
any
known
animal
some
of
the
most
ancient
silurian
ani
mals
as
the
nautilus
lingula
&c
do
not
differ
much
from
living
tx};])ecies
and
it-cannot
on
my
theory
be
su
posed
that
these
old
species
were
the
progenitors
of
hi
the
species
of
the
orders
to
which
they
belong
for
they
do
not
ﬁresent
characters
in
any
degree
intermediate
be
tween
them
if
moreover
they
had
been
the
progenitors
of
these
orders
they
would
ost
certainly
have
been
long
ago
su];gla.nted
and
exterminted
by
their
numerous
and
improved
descendants
consequently
if
my
theory
be
true
it
is
indisputable
that
before
the
lowest
silurian
stratum
was
deposited
long
periods
elapsed
as
long
as
or
probably
far
longer
than
the
whole
interval
from
the
sﬁurian
age
to
the
present
day
and
that
during
these
vast
yet
quite
unknown
periods
of
time
the
world
swarmed
with
living
crea
tures
to
the
t%huestion
why
we
do
not
find
records
of
these
vast
primordial
periods
can
give
no
satisfactory
answer
several
of
the
most
eminent
geologists
with
sir
r
mur
chison
at
their
head
are
convinced
that
we
see
in
the
or
ganic
remains
of
the
lowest
silurian
stratum
the
dawn
of
iife
on
this
planet
other
highly
competent
judges
as
lyell
and
the
late
e
forbes
dispute
this
conclusion
we
should
not
forget
that
only
small
portion
of
the
world
is
known
with
accuracy
k{
barrande
has
lately
added
another
and
lower
stage
to
the
silurian
system
abounding
with
new
and
peculiar
species
traces
of
life
have
been
detected
in
the
longmynd
beds
beneath
barrande’s
so
called
primordial
zone
~the
presence
of
phosphatic
nod
ules
and
bituminous
matter
in
some
of
the
lowest
azcic
rocks
probably
indicates
the
former
existence
of
life
at
these
periods
but
the
difficulty
of
understanding
the
absence
of
vast
piles
of
fossiliferous
strata
which
on
my
theory
no
doubt
were
somewhat
accumulated
before
the
silurian
epoch
is
very
great
if
these
most
ancient
beds
had
been
wholly
worn
away
by
denudation
or
obliterated
by
metamorphic
action
we
ought
to
find
only
small
rem
nants
of
the
formations.next
succeeding
them
in
age
and
270
tmperfection
of
the
cmar
ix
these
ought
to
be
very
generally
in
metomorphosed
con
dition
%ut
the
descriptions
which
we
now
possess
of
the
silurian
deposits
over
1mmense
territories
in
russia
and
in
north
america
do
not
support
the
view
that
the
older
formation
is
the
more
it
has
suffered
the
extremity
of
denudation
and
metamorphism
the
case
at
present
must
remain
inexplicable
and
may
be
truly
urged
as
valid
argument
against
the
views
here
entertained
to
show
that
it
may
hereafter
receive
some
explanation
will
give
the
following
hypothesis
from
the
nature
of
the
organic
remains
which
do
not
ap
ear
to
have
inhabited
profound
depths
in
the
several
ormations
of
europe
and
of
the
united
states
and
from
the
amount
of
sediment
miles
in
thickness
of
which
the
formations
are
composed
we
may
infer
that
from
first
to
last
large
islands
or
tracts
of
land
whence
the
sediment
was
derived
occurred
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
exist
ing
continents
of
europe
and
north
america
but
we
do
not
know
what
was
the
state
of
things
in
the
intervals
between
the
successive
formations
whether
europe
and
the
united
states
during
these
intervals
existed
as
d
land
or
as
submarine
surface
near
land
on
which
sedi
ment
was
not
deposited
or
again
as
the
bed
of
an
open
and
unfathomable
sea
lookihg
to
the
existing
oceans
which
are
thrice
as
extensive
as
the
land
we
see
them
studded
with
many
islands
but
not
one
oceanic
island
is
as
yet
known
to
afford
even
remnant
of
any
palsozoic
or
secondary
for
mation
hence
we
may
perhaps
infer
that
during
the
pal@ozoic
and
secondary
periods
neither
continents
nor
continental
islands
existed
where
our
oceans
now
extend
for
had
they
existed
there
pal®ozoic
and
secondary
forma
tions
would
in
all
probability
have
been
accumulated
from
sediment
derived
from
their
wear
and
tear
and
would
have
been
at
least
partially
upheaved
by
the
oscillations
of
level
which
we
may
fairlly
conclude
must
have
intervened
dur
ing
these
enormously
long
periods
if
then
we
may
infer
anything
from
these
facts
we
may
infer
that
where
our
oceans
now
extend
oceans
have
extended
from
the
remot
est
period
of
which
we
have
any
record
and
on
the
other
crur
ix
geological
record
an
hand
that
where
continents
now
exist
large
tracts
of
land
have
existed
subjected
no
doubt
to
great
oscillations
of
level
since
the
earliest
silurian
period
the
coloured
mdp
agpended
to
my
volume
on
coral
reefs
led
me
to
conclude
that
the
great
oceans
are
still
mainly
areas
of
subsidence
the
great
archipelagoes
still
areas
of
oscilla
tions
of
level
and
the
continents
areas
of
elevation
but
have
we
any
right
to
assume
that
things
have
thus
re
mained
from
eternity
our
continents
seem
to
have
been
formed
by
preponderance
during
many
oscillations
of
level
of
the
force
of
elevation
but
may
not
the
areas
of
preponderant
movement
have
chan
in
the
lapse
of
ages
at
period
immeasurably
antecedent
to
the
silu
rian
epoch
continents
may
have
existed
where
oceans
are
now
spread
out
and
clear
and
open
oceans
may
have
ex
isted
where
our
continents
now
stand
nor
should
we
be
i;“sﬁﬁed
in
assuming
that
if
for
instance
the
bed
of
the
acific
ocean
were
now
converted
into
continent
we
should
there
find
formations
older
than
the
silurian
strata
sup)})losin
such
to
have
been
formerly
deposited
for
it
might
well
happen
that
strata
which
had
subsided
some
iles
nearer
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
and
which
had
been
pressed
on
by
an
enormous
weight
of
superincum
bent
water
might
have
undergone
far
more
metamorphic
action
than
strata
which
have
always
remained
nearer
to
the
surface
the
immense
areas
in
some
parts
of
the
world
for
instance
in
south
america
of
bare
metamor
phic
rocks
which
must
have
been
heated
under
great
pressure
have
always
seemed
to
me
to
require
some
special
explanation
and
we
may
perhaps
believe
that
we
see
in
these
large
areas
the
many
formations
long
anterior
to
the
silurian
epoch
in
completely
metamorphosed
con
dition
the
several
difficulties
here
discussed
namely
our
not
finding
in
the
successive
formations
infinitely
numerous
transitional
links
between
the
many
species
which
now
exist
or
have
existed

sudden
manner
in
which
whole
groups
appear
in
our
european
formations

almost

absence

at

of
fossiliferons
for

imperfection
of

cmar
ix
mations
beneath
the

strata
are
all
undoubtedly
of
the
gravest
nature
we
see
this
in
the
plainest
manner

the
fact
that
all

all

the

seem
to
change
at
quicker
rate
than
those
of
the

of
which
striking
instance
has
lately
been
observed
in

there
is
some
reason
to
believe
that
organisms
considered
high
in
the
scale
of
nature
change
more
quickly
than
those
that
are
low
though
there
are
exceptions
to
this
rule
the
amount
of
organic
change
as
pictet
has
remarked
does
not
strictly
correspond
with
the
succession
of
our
geologi
cal
formations
so
that
between
each
two
consecutive
formations
the
forms
of
life
have
seldom
changed
in
ex
actly
the
same
degree
yet
if
we
compare
any
but
the
most
closely
related
formations
all
the
species
will
be
found
to
have
undergone
some
change
en
species

once
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
earth
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
same
identical
form
never
re
appears
the
strongest
apparent
exception
to
this
latter
rule
is
that
of
the
so«calleg
colonies
of
m
barrande
which
intrude
for
period
in
the
midst
of
an
older
forma

and
then
allow
the
pre-existing

to

but
lyell’s
explanation
namely
that
it
is
case
of
tem
porary

from

province
seems
to
me
satisfactory
these
several
facts
accord
well

theory

be
lieve
in

cansing
all
the
in

of

must
be
extremely
slow
the
variability
of
each
species
is
quite
independent
of
that
of
all
others
hether
such

be
taken
advantage
of
by
nat

and
whether
the

be

to
greater

thus
causing
greater

lesser
amount
of
modification
in

eends
on

contingencies,—on
the

of

on
the
power
of

on
the
rate
of

on
the
slowly
changing
physical
conditions
of
the
country
and
more
especiaﬁy
on
the
nature
of
the
other
inhabitants
with
which
the
varying
species
come
into
competition
hence
it
is
by
no
means
surprising
that
one
species
should
retain
the
same
identi
cal
form
much
longer
than
others
or
if
changing
that
it
should
change
less
we
see
the
same
fact
in
geographical
distribution
for
instance
in
the
land-shells
and
coleop
terous
insects
of
madeira
having
come
to
differ
consider
ably
from
their
nearest
allies
on
the
continent
of
europe
whereas
the
marine
shells
and
birds
have
remained
un
altered
we
can
perhaps
understand
the
apparently
quicker
rate
of
change
in
terrestrial
and
in
more
highly
organised
productions
compared
with
marine
and
lower
grodnctions
by
the
more
complex
relations
of
the
higher
eings
to
their
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
of
life
as
explained
in
former
chapter
%?vhen
many
of
the
inhab
itants
of
country
have
become
modified
and

we
can
understand
on_the
principle
of
competition
and
on
that
of
the
many
all-important
relations
of
organism
to
organism
that
any
form
which
does
not
become
in
some
degree
modified
and
improved
will
be
liable
to
be
exterminated
hence
we
can
see
why
all
the
species
in
the
same
region
do
at
last
if
we
look
to
wide
enough
in
tervals
of
time
become
modified
for
those
which
do
not
change
will
become
extinct
in
members
of
the
same
class
the
average
amount
of
change
during
long
and
equal
periods
of
time
may
per
haps
be
nearly
the
same
but
as
the
accumulation
of
long
enduring
fossiﬁferous
formations
depends
on
great
masses
of
sediment
having
been
depositedp
on
areas
whilst
sub
siding
our
formations
have
been
almost
necessarily
accu
mulated
at
wide
and
irregularly
intermittent
intervals
consequently
the
amount
of
organic
change
exhibited
by
the
fossils
embedded
in
consecutive
formations
is
not
equal
each
formation
on
this
view
does
not
mark
13

succesbion
vmar
x
new
and
complete
act
of
creation
but
only
an
occasional
scene
taken
almost
at
hazard
in
slowly
changing
drama
we
can
clearly
understand
why
species
when
once
lost
should
never
reappear
even
if
the
very
same
con
ditions
of
life
organic
and
inorganic
should
recur
for
though
the
offspring
of
one
species
might
be
adapted
and
no
doubt
this
has
occurred
in
innumerable
instances
to
fill
the
exact
place
of
another
species
in
the
economy
of
nature
and
tlll)us
supplant
it
yet
the
two
forms—the
old
and
the
new—wouf(f
not
be
identically
the
same
for
both
would
almost
certainly
inherit
different
characters
from
their
distinct
progenitors
for
instance
it
is
just
ossible
if
our
fantail-pigeons
were
all
destroyed
that
a.nciers
by
striving
during
long
ages
for
the
same
object
might
make
new
breed
hardly
distinguishable
from
our
gresent
fantail
but
if
the
parent
rock-pigeon
were
also
estrog'ed
and
in
nature
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
parent-form
will
generally
be
supplanted
and
ex
terminated
by
its
improved
offspring
it
is
quite
incredible
that
fantail
identical
with
the
existing
breed
could
be
raised
from
any
other
species
of
pigeon
or
even
from
the
other
well-established
races
of
the
domestic
pigeon
for
newly-formed
fantail
would
be
almost
sure
to
inherit
from
its
new
progenitor
some
slight
characteristic
differ
ences
groups
of
species
that

and

the

or
its

am

that
there
are
some
apparent

to
this
rule
but
the
exceptions
are
surprisi
ily

so
few
that

though
all
strongly

rule
strictly
accords
with
my
theory
for
as
all
the
species
of

have
descend:g
from
some
one
species
it
is
clear
that
as
long
as
any
species
of
the
group
have
appeared
in
the
long
succession
of
ages
so
long
must
its
members
have
contin

x

existed
in
order
to
have
generated
either
new
and
modified
or
the

unmodified
forms
species
of
the
genus
lingula
for
instance
must
have
continu
ously
existed
by
an
unbroken
succession
of
generations
from
the
lowest
silurian
stratum
to
the
present
day
we
have
seen
in
the
last
chapter
that
the
species
of
group
sometimes
falsely
appear
to
have
come
in
abruptly
and
have
attempted
to
give
an
explanation
of
this
fact
which
if
true
would
have
been
fatal
to
my
views
but
such
cases
are
certainly
exceptional
the
general
rule
be
ing
gradual
increase
in
number
till
the
group
reaches
its
maximum
and
then
sooner
or
later
it
gradually
de
creases
if
the
number
of
the
species
of
genus
or
the
number
of
the
genera
of
family
be
represented
by
vertical
line
of
varying
thickmess
crossing
the
successive
logical
formations
in
which
the
species
are
found
the
ine
will
sometimes
falsely
appear
to
begin
at
its
lower
end
not
in
sharp
point
{vut
abruptly
it
then
gradually
thickens
upwards
sometimes
keeping
for
space
of
equal
thickness
and
ultimately
thins
out
in
the
upper
beds
marking
the
decrease
and
final
extinction
of
tﬁe
species
this
gradual
increase
in
number
of
the
species
of
group
is
strictly
conformable
with
my
theory
as
the
species
of
the
same
genus
and
the
genera
of
the
same
family
can
increase
only
slowly
and
progressively
for
the
process
of
modification
and
the
production
of
number
of
allied
forms
must
be
slow
and
gradual,—one
species
giving
rise
first
to
two
or
three
varieties
these
being
slowly
con
verted
into
species
which
in
their
turn
produce
by
equally
slow
steps
other
species
and
so
on
like
the
branching
of
great
tree
grom
single

till
the
group
becomes
large
on
eutinction.—we
have
as
yet
spoken
only
inci
dentally
of
the
disappearance
of
species
and
of
groups
of
species
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
the
extinc
tion
of
old
forms
and
the
production
of
new
and
improved
forms
are
intimately
connected
together
the
old
notion
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
having
been
swept
away
at
successive
periods
by

is

whose
general
views
would
naturally
lead
them
to
this
conclusion
on
the
contrary
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
from
the
study
of
the
tertiary
formations
that
species
and
groups
of
species
gradually
disappear
one
after

first
from
one
spot
then
from
another
and
finally
from
the

no

seems
to
determine
the
length
of

durinﬁlwhich
any
single
sgecies
or
any
single
genus
endures
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
complete
extinction
of
the
species
of
group
is
generally
slower
process
than
their
production
if
the
appearance
and
disappearance
of

of
species
be
represented
as

of

the
line
is
found
to
taper
more
gradually
at
its
upper
end
which
marks
the
progress
of
extermination
than
at
its
lower
end
which
marks
the
first
appearance
and
increase
in
numbers
of
the
species
in
some
cases
however
the
extermination
of
whole
groups
of
beings
as
of
ammon
ites
towards
the
close
of
the
secondary
period
has
been
wonderfully
sudden
the
whole
subject
of
the
extinction
of
species
has
been
involved
in
the
most
gratuitous
mystery
some
authors
have
even
supposed
that
as
the
indivil(%al
has
definite
length
of
life
so
have
species
definite
duration
no
one
think
can
have
marvelled
more
at
the
extinction
of

than
have
done
when
found
in

the
tooth
of

embedded
with

toxodon
and

extinct

which
all
co-existed
with
still

at

late

period
was
filled
with
astonishment
for
seeing
that
the
horse
since
its
introduction
by
the
span
jards
into
south
america
has
run
wild
over
the
whole
country
and
has
increased
in
numbers
at
an
unparalleled
rate
asked
myself
what
could
so
recently
have
exter
minated
the
former
horse
under
conditions
of
life
appar
omur
mmc'non
279
ently
so
favourable
but
how
utterly
groundless
was
my
astonishment
professor
owen
soon
perceived
that
the
tooth
though
so
like
that
of
the
existing
horse
belonged
to
an
extinct
species
had
this
horse
been
still
living
but
in
some
degree
rare
no
naturalist
would
have
felt
the
least
surprise
at
its
rarity
for
rarity
is
the
attribute
of
vast
number
of
species
of
all
classes
in
all
countries
if
we
ask
ourselves
why
this
or
that
species
is
rare
we
answer
that
something
is
unfavourable
in
its
conditions
of
life
but
what
that
something
is
we
can
hardly
ever
tell
on
the
supposition
of
the
fossil
horse
still
existing
as
rare
species
we
might
have
felt
certain
from
the
analogy
of
all
other
mammals
even
of
the
slow-breeding
elephant
and
from
the
history
of
the
naturalisation
of
the
domestic
horse
in
south
america
that
under
more
favourable
con
ditions
it
would
in
very
few
years
have
stocked
the
whole
continent
but
we
could
not
have
told
what
the
unfavourable
conditions
were
which
checked
its
increase
whether
some
one
qr
several
contingencies
and
at
what
period
of
the
horse’s
life
and
in
what
degree
they
sever
ally
acted
if
the
conditions
had
gone
on
however
slow
ly
becoming
less
and
less
favourable
we
assuredly
should
not
have
perceived
the
fact
yet
the
fossil
horse
would
certainly
have
become
rarer
and
rarer
and
finally
ex
tinet
its
place
being
seized
on
by
some
more
successful
competitor
is
most
difficult
always
to
remember
that
the
increase
of
every
living
being
is
constantly
being
checked
by
unper
ceived
injurious
a%encies
and
that
these
same
unperceived
agencies
are
amply
sufficient
to
cause
rarity
and
finally
extinction
we
see
in
many
cases
in
the
more
recent
tertiary
formations
that
rarity
precedes
extinction
and
we
know
that
this
has
been
the
progress
of
events
with
those
animals
which
have
been
exterminated
either
locall
or
wholly
through
man’s
agency
miay
repeat
what
published
in
1845
namely
that
to
admit
that
species
nerally
become
rare
before
they
become
extinct—to
ieel
no
surprise
at
the
rarity
of
species
and
yet
to
marvel
greatly
when
it
ceases
to
exist
is
much
the
same
as
to
admit
that
sickness
in
the
individual
is
the
forerunner
280
geological
succession
cur
x
of
death—to
feel
no
surprise
at
sickness
but
when
the
sick
man
dies
to
wonder
and
to
suspect
that
he
died
by
some
unknown
deed
of
violence
the
theory
of
natural
selection
is
grounded
on
the
belief
that
each
new
variety
and
ultimately
each
new
species
is
produced
and
maintained
by
having
some
ad
vantage
over
those
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
and
the
consequent
extinction
of
less-favoured
forms
almost
inevitably
follows
it
is
the
same
with
our
do
mestic
productions
when
new
and
slightly
improved
varietg
as
been
raised
it
at
first
supplants
the
less
im
roved
varieties
in
the
same
neighbourhood
when
much
improved
it
is
transported
far
and
near
like
our
short
horned
cattle
and
takes
the
place
of
other
breeds
in
other
countries
thus
the
appearance
of
new
forms
and
the
disappearance
of
old
fgrms
both
natural
and
artificial
are
bound
together
in
certain
flourishing
groups
the
number
of
new
specific
forms
which
have
been
produced
within
given
time
is
probably
greater
than
that
of
the
old
forms
which
have
been
exterminated
but
we
know
that
the
number
of
species
has
not
gone
on
indefinitely
increasing
at
least
during
the
later
geological
periods
so
that
looking
to
later
times
we
may
belicve
that
the
pro
duction
of
new
forms
has
caused
the
extinction
of
about
the
same
number
of
old
forms
the
competition
will
generally
be
most
severe
as
formerly
explained
and
illustrated
by
examples
between
the
forms
which
are
most
like
each
other
in
all
respects
hence
the
improved
and
modified
descendants
of
species
will
generally
cause
the
extermination
of
the
parent
species
and
1f
many
new
forms
have
been
developed
from
any
one
species
the
nearest
allies
of

therefore
the
utter
extinction
of

is
generally
as
we
have
seen
slower

than
its
production
with
respect
to
the
apparently
sudden
extermination
of
whole

as
of
trilobites
at
the
close
of

and
of
ammonites
at

we
must
remember
what
has
been
already
said
on
the
probable
wide
intervals
of

be

and
in

there
may
have
been

slow

more

by
sudden
immigration

by

rapid

many
species
of

have
taken

they
will
have

rapid

many
of
the

ants
and
the
forms
which
thus
yield
their
places
will
commonly
be
allied
for
they
will
partake
of
some

thus
as
it
seems
to
me
the
manner
in
which
single
species
and
whole
groups
of

become
extinct
accords
well
with
the
theory
of

we
need
not

it

the

similar

it

as

coexisted

it
might
at

have
been
inferred
that

of

it

that

the

it

as
the
cause
of
these
great

in

throughout

under

we
must
as
barrande
has
remarked
look

we

clearly
when
we
treat

and
find
how
slight
is
the

between
the

this
great
fact
of
the
parallel
succession
of
the

throughout
the

is
explicable
on
the
theory
of
natural
seﬁaction
new

are
formed
by
new
va
rieties
arising
which
have
some
advantage
over

and
those
forms
which
are
already

or
have
some
advantage
over
the
other
forms
in
their
own
country
would
naturally
oftenest
give

new

or
incipient
species
for
these
latter
must
be

to
be

have
distinct
evidence
on
this
head
in
the
lants
which
are

that
is
which
are
commonest
in
their
own
homes
and
aremost
widely
diffused
having
produced
the
greatest
number
of
new
varieties
it
is
also
patural
that
the
dominant
varying
and
far-spreading
species
which
already
have
invaded
to
certain
extent
territories
of
other
species
should
be
those
which
would
have
the
best
chance
of
spreading
still
further
and
cmr
throughout
the

85
of
giving
rise
in
new
countries
to
new
varieties
and

the
process
of
diffusion
may
often
be
very
slow
being
dependent
on
climatal
and
tieo%mphical
changes
or
on
strange
accidents
but
in
the
long
run
the
dominant
forms
will
generally
succeed
in
spreading

it

probable
be
lower
with
the
terrestrial

than
with
the

of
the

we
mifht
therefore
expect
to
find
as
we
apparently
do
find

in
the

we
ow
not
at

precisely
what
are
all
the
conditions
most
favourable
for
the
multiplication
of
new
and
dominant
species
but
we
can
think
clearly
see
that
number
of
individuals
from
giving
better
iance
of
the
appear
ance
of
favourable
variations
and
that
severe
competition
with
many
already
existing
forms
would
be
highly
fa
vourable
as
would
be
the
power
of
spreading
into
new
territories
a
certain
amount
of
isolation
recurring
at
long
intervals
of
time
would
probably
be
also
favourable
as
before
explained
one
quarter
of
the
world
may
have
been
most
favourable
for
the
production
of
new
and
dom
inant
species
on
the
land
and
another
for
those
in
the
waters
of
the
sea
if
two
great
regions
had
been
for
long
period
favourably
circumstanced
in
an
equal
degree
whenever
their
inhabitants
met
the
battle
would
be
pro
longed
and
severe
and
some
from
one
birthplace
and
some
from
the
other
might
be
victorious
but
in
the
course
of
time
the
forms
dominant
in
the
highest
degree
wherever
produced
would
tend
everywhere
to
prevail
as
they
prevailed
they
would
cause
the
extinction
of
other
and
inferior
forms
and
as
these
inferior
forms
would
be
allied
in
groups
by
inheritance
whole
groups
would
tend
slowly
to
disappear
though
here
and
gll'ere

might

be

thus

one
other
remark
connected
with
this
subject
worth
making
have
given
my
reasons
for
believi
that
all
our
greater
fossiliferous
formations
were
deposit
during
periods
of
subsidence
and
that
blank
intervals
of
vast
duration
occurred
during
the
periods
when
the
bed
of
the
sea
was
either
stationary
or
rising
and
like
wise
when
sediment
was
not
thrown
down
quickly
enough
to
embed
and
preserve
organic
remains
during
these
long
and
blank
intervals
fsuppose
that
the
inhabitants
of
each
region
underwent
considerable
amount
of
modi
fication
and
extinction
and
that
there
was
much
migration
from
other
parts
of
the
world
as
we
have
reason
to
be
lieve
that
large
areas
are
affected
by
the
same
movement
it
is
probable
that
strictly
contemporaneous
formations
have
often
been
accumulated
over
very
wide
spaces
in
the
same
quarter
of
the
world
but
we
are
far
from
having
any
right
to
conclude
that
this
has
invariably
been
the
case
and
that
large
areas
have
invariably
been
affected
by
the
same
movements
when
two
formations
have
been
de
posited
in
two
regions
during
nearly
but
not
exactly
the
same
period
we
should
find
in
both
from
the
causes
explained
in
the

paragraphs
the

the

mr
prestwich
in

of

france
is
able
to
draw
close
general

stages
in

two
countries

when
he
compares

he
finds
in

in
the

the

themselves
differ
in
manner
very
difficult
to
account
for
considering
the
proximity
of
the

areas,—unless
indeed
it
be
assumed
that
an
isthmus

by

lyell
has
made
similar

also
shows
that
there

nevertheless
he
finds
sur
})rising
amount
of
difference
in
the
species
if
the
several
ormations
in
these
regions
have
not
been
deposited
during
the

exact
periods,—a
formation
in
one
region
often
corresponding
with
blank
interval
in
the
other,—and
if
in
both
regions
the
species
have
gone
on
slowly
changin
during
the
accumulation
of
the
several
formations
an§
during
the
long
intervals
of

between
them
in
this
case
ae
several
formations
in

could
be
arranged
in
the

order
in

with
the
general
succession
of
the

and
the
order
would
falsely
appear
to
be
strictly

nevertheless
the

would
not
all
be

apparently

in

us
now
look

they
all
fall
into

this

by
this
term
it
is
meant
that
an
extinct
form
is
directly
intermediate
in
all
its
char

between
two
living

the
objection
is
probably
valid
but
apprehend
that
in

natural
classi

many
fossil
species
would
have
to
stand
between

and
some
extinct

he
most
common

especially
with

to
very
distinet
groups
such
as
fish
and
reptiles
seems
to
be
that
supposinﬁ
them
to
be
distinguished
at
the
present
day
from

by

the
ancient
mem
bers
of
the

two

would
be
distinguished
by
somewhat
lesser
num%:r
of

so
that
the
two

though
formerly
quite
distinct
at
that
period
made
some
small
approach
to
each
other
it
is
common
}l))elief
that

more
ancient

by
so
much
the
more
it
tends
to
connect
by
some
of
its

grou%s
now
widely
separated

this
remark
no
doubt
must
be
restricted
to
those

cmar
x1
affinities
of
extinot
bpecies
289
which
have
undergone
much
change
in
the
course
of
geological
ages
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
proposition
for
every
now
and
then
even
living
animal
as
the
lepidosiren
is
discovered
havin
affinities
directed
towards
very
distinct
groups
yet
we
compare
the
older
reptiles
and
batrachians
the
older
fish
the
older
cephalopods
and
the
eocene
mammals
with
the
more
recent
members
of
the
same
classes
we
must
admit
that
there
is
some
truth
in
the
remark
let
us
see
how
far
these
several
facts
and
inferences
accord
with
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
as
the
subject
is
somewhat
complex
must
request
the
reader
to
turn
to
the
diagram
in
the
fourth
chapter
we
may
suppose
that
the
numbered
letters
represent
genera
and
the
dotted
lines
diverging
from
them
the
species
in
each
genus
the
diagram
is
much
too
sim&l
too
few
genera
and
too
few
species
being
given
but
this
is
unimportant
for
us
the
horizontal
lines
may
represent
successive
geoloii;al
formations
and
all
the
forms
beneath
the
upper
most
line
may
be
considered
as
extinct
the
three
exist
ing
geners
a
¢
p
will
form
small
family
5
and
s
closely
allied
family
or
sub-family
and
0
¢
m
third
family
these
three
families
together
with
the
many
extinct
genera
on
the
several
lines
of
descent
diverging
from
the
parent-form
a
will
form
an
order
for
all
will
have
inherited
something
in
common
from
their
ancient
and
common
progenitor
on
the
principle
of
the
continued
tendency
to
divergence
of
character
which
was
formerly
illustrated
by
this
diagram
the
more
recent
any
form
is
the
more
it
will
generally
differ
from
its
ancient
progenitor
hence
we
can
understand
the
rule
that
the
most
ancient
fossils
differ
most
from
existing
forms
we
must
not
however
assume
that
divergence
of
character
is
necessary
contingency
it
depends
solely
on
the
descendants
from
species
being
thus
enabled
to
seize
on
many
and
different
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
therefore
it
is
quite
possible
as
we
have
seen
in
the
case
of
some
silurian
forms
that
species
mit%ht
go
on
bein
slightly
modified
in
relation
to
its
slightly
altered
condi
tions
of
life
and
yet
retain
throughout
vast
period
the
200
geologioal
succession
tour
x
same
general
characteristics
this
is
represented
in
the
diagram
by
the
letter
¥
all
the
many
forms
extinct
and
recent
descended
from
a
make
as
before
remarked
one
order
and
this
order
from
the
continued
effects
of
extinction
and
diver
ence
of
character
has
become
divided
into
several
sub
families
and
families
some
of
which
are
supposed
to
have
perished
at
different
periods
and
some
to
have
endured
to
the
present
day
looking
at
the
diagram
we
can
see
that
if
many
of
the
extinct
forms
supposed
to
be
embedded
in
the
successive
formations
were
discovered
at
several
points
low
down
in
the
series
the
three
existing
families
on
the
uppermost
line
would
be
rendered
less
distinct
from
each
other
if
for
instance
the
genera
o
a
a®
f°
m
m
m
were
disinterred
these
three
families
would
be
so
closely
linked
together
that
they
probably
would
have
to
be
united
into
one
great
family
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
has
occurred
with
ruminants
and
pac{:yderms
yet
he
who
objected
to
call
the
extinet
genera
which
thus
linked
the
living
genera
of
three
families
together
intermediate
in
character
would
be
justified
as
they
are
intermediate
not
directly
but
only
by
long
and
circuitous
course
through
many
widely
different
forms
if
many
extinct
forms
were
to
be
discovered
above
one
of
the
middle
horizontal
lines
or
geological
formations—for
instance
above
no
vi.—but
none
from
beneath
this
line
then
only
the
two
families
on
the
left
hand
namely
¥
&ec
and
5
&c
would
have
to
be
united
into
one
family
and
the
two
other
families
namely
a
to
/™
now
includ
ing
five
genera
and
0
to
m™
would
yet
remain
distinct
these
two
families
however
would
be
less
distinct
from
each
other
than
they
were
before
the
discovery
of
the
fossils
if
for
instance
we
suppose
the
existing
genera
of
the
two
families
to
differ
from
each
other
by
dozen
characters
in
this
case
the
genera
at
the
early
period
marked
vi
would
differ
by
a%esser
number
of
characters
for
at
this
early
stage
of
descent
they
have
not
dive:ged
in
character
from
the
common
progenitor
of
the
order
nearly
so
much
as
they
subsequently
diverged
thus
it
omr
x
affinities
of
extinct
species
291
comes
that
ancient
and
extinct
genera
are
often
in
some
slight
degree
intermediate
in
character
between
their
modified
gescendants
or
between
their
collateral
relations
in
nature
the
case
will
be
far
more
complicated
than
is
represented
in
the
diagram
for
the
groups
will
have
been
more
numerous
they
will
have
endured
for
extremely
unequal
lengths
of
time
and
will
have
been
modified
in
various
degrees
as
we
possess
only
the
last
volume
of
the
eeological
record
and
that
in
very
broken
condition
we
have
no
right
to
expect
except
in
very
rare
cases
to
fill
up
wide
intervals
in
the
na.turiaf
system
and
thus
unite
distinet
families
or
orders
all
that
we
have
right
to
expect
is
that
those
groups
which
have
within
known
logical
periods
undergone
much
modification
should
in
older
formations
make
some
slight
approach
to
each
other
so
that
the
older
members
should
differ
less
from
each
other
in
some
of
their
characters
than
do
the
existing
members
of
the
same
groups
and
this
by
the
concurrent
evidence
of
our
best
palmontologists
seems
frequently
to
be
the
case
thus
on
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
the
main
facts
with
respect
to
the
mutual
affinities
of
the
extinet
forms
of
life
to
each
other
and
to
living
forms
seem
to
me
explained
in
satisfactory
manner
and
they
are
wholly
inexplicable
on
any
other
view
on
this
same
theory
it
is
evident
that
the
fauna
of
any
eat
period
in
the
earth’s
history
will
be
intermediate
1n
general
character
between
that
which
preceded
and
that
which
succeeded
it
thus
the
species
which
lived
at
the
sixth
great
stage
of
descent
in
the
diagram
are
the
modi
fied
offspring
of
those
which
lived
at
the
fifth
stage
and
are
the
parents
of
those
which
became
still
more
modi
fied
at
the
seventh
stage
hence
they
could
hardly
fail
to
be
nearly
intermediate
in
character
between
the
forms
of
life
above
and
below
we
must
however
allow
for
the
entire
extinction
of
some
preceding
forms
and
for
the
coming
in
of
quite
new
forms
by
immigration
and
for
large
amount
of
modification
during
the
long
and
blank
intervals
between
the
successive
formations
subject
to
these
allowances
the
fauna
of
each
geological
period

x
doubtedly

intermediate
in

between
the
pre
ceding
and
succeeding
faunas
need
give
only
one
instance
namely
the
manner
in
which
the
fossils
of
the
devonian
system
when
this
system
was
first
discovered
were
at
once
recognised
by
paleontologists
as
intermediate
in
character
between
those
of
the
overlying
carboniferous
and
underlying
silurian
system
but
each
fauna
is
not
necessarily
exs,:;liy
intermediate
a8
unequal
intervals

it
is
no
real
objection
to
the
truth
of
the
statement
that
the
fauna
of
each
period
as
whole
is
nearly
intermediate
in
character
between
the
preceding
and
succeeding
faunas
that
certain
genera
offer
exceptions
to
the
rule
for
in

mastodons
and
elephants
when
arranged
by

in
two

according

supposing
for
an
instant
in
this
and
other
such
cases
that
the
record
of
the
first
appearance
and
disappearance
of
the
species
was
perfect
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
forms

necessarily
endure
for
corresponding
lengths
of

very

occasionally

in

203
intermediate
in

is
the
fact
insisted
on
by
all
paleontologists
that
fossils
from
two
consecutive
for
mations
are
far
more
closely
related
to
each
other
than
are
the
fossils
from
two
remote
formations
~pictet
gives
as
well-known
instance
the
general
resemblance
of
the
organic
remains
from
the
several
stages
of
the
chalk
for
mation
though
the
species
are
distinet
in
each
stage
this
fact
alone
from
its
generality
seems
to
have
shaken
professor
pictet
in
his
firm
belief
in
the
immutability
of
species
he
who
is
acquainted
with
the
distribution
of
existing
species
over
the
globe
will
not
attempt
to
ac
count
for
the
close
resemblance
of
the
distinct
species
in
closely
consecutive
formations
by
the
})hysical
conditions
of
the
ancient
areas
having
remained
nearly
the
sawe
let
it
be
remembered
that
t%e
forms
of
life
at
least
those
inhabiting
the
sea
have
changed
almost
simultaneously
throughout
the
world
and
therefore
under
the
most
differ
ent
climates
and
conditions
consider
the
prodigious
vi
cissitudes
of
climate
during
the
pleistocene
period
which
in
cludes
the
whole
glacial
period
and
note
how
little
the
spe
cific
forms
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
sea
have
been
affected
on
the
theory
of
descent
the
full
meaning
of
the
fact
of
fossil
remains
from
closely
consecutive
formations
though
ranked
as
distinet
species
being
closely
related
is
obvious
as
the
accumulation
of
each
formation
has
often
been
interrupted
and
as
long
blank
intervals
have
inter
vened
between
successive
formations
we
ought
not
to
ex
pect
to
find
as
attempted
to
show
in
the
last
chapter
in
any
one
or
fwo
formations
all
the
intermediate
varieties
between
the
species
which
appeared
at
the
commence
ment
and
close
of
these
periods
but
we
ought
to
find
after
intervals
very
long
as
measured
by
years
but
only
moderately

as

eologicnﬁy
closely

as
they
have
been
called
by
some
authors
re}a-re

and
these
we
assuredly
do
find
find
in
short
such
evidence
of
the
slow
and
scarcely
sen
sible
mutation
of
specific
forms
as
we
have
just
right
to
expect
to
find
on
the
state
of

of
ancient

there
has
been

will
not
here

on

subject
for
naturalists
have
not
as
yet
defined
to
each
other’s
satisfaction
what
is
meant
by
high
and
low
forms
the
best
definition
probably
is
that
the
higher
forms
have
their
organs
more
distinctly
specialised
for
different
functions
and
as
such
division
of
physiological
labour
seems
to
be
an
advantage
to
each
being
natural
selection
will
constantly
tend
in
so
far
to
make
the
later
and
more
modified
forms
higher
than
their
early
progeni
tors
or
than
the
slightly
modified
descendants
of
such
pro
genitors
in
more
general
sense
the
more
recent
forms
must
on
my
theory
be
higherthan
the
more
ancient
for
each
new
species
is
formed
by
having
had
some
advan
tage
in
the
stm¥gle
for
life
over
other
and
preceding
forms
if
under
nearly
similar
climate
the
eocene
inhabitants
of
one
quarter
of
the
world
were
put
into
competition
with
the
existing
inhabitants
of
the
same
or
some
other
quarter
the
eocene
fauna
or
flora
would
certainly
be
beaten
and
exterminated
as
would
secondary
fauna
by
an
eocene
and
i»lalwozoie
fauna
by

do
not
doubt
that
this
process
of
improvement
has
affect
ed
in
marked
and
sensible
manner
the
organisation
of
the
more
recent
and
victorious
forms
of
life
in
compari
son
with
the
ancient
and
beaten
forms
but
can
see
no
way
of
testing
this
sort
of
progress
crustaceans

not
the

may
have
beaten
the

from
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
eurogean
productions
have
recently
spread
over
new

and
have
seized
on
places
which
must
have
been
previously
occupied
we
may
believe
if
all
the
ani

and
plants
of
great

were
set
free
in
new

that
in
the
course
of

multitude
of
british
forms
would
become
thoroughly
naturalized
there
and
would
exterminate
many
of
the
natives
on
the
other
hand
from
what
we
see
now
occurring
in
new
zealand
and
from
hardly
single
inhabitant
of
the
southern
hem

having
become
wild
in
any
part
of

we
may
doubt
if
all
the
productions
of
new

were
set
free
in
great
britain
whether
any
considerable
number
would
be
enabled
to

agassiz

that

the

that
the

followr%ictet

that
the

is
very

yet
fully
expect
to
see
it
hereafter
confirmed
at

in

to

which
have
branched
off

chapter
shall
attempt
to
show
that
the
adult
differs
from
1ts
embryo
owing
to
variations
supervening
at
not
early
age
and
being
inherited
at
corresponding
age
this
process
whilst
it
leaves
the
embryo
almost
unaltered
continually
adds
in
the
course
of
successive
generations
more
and
more
difference
to
the
adult
thus
the
embryo
comes
to
be
left
as
sort
of
picture
sreserved
by
nature
of
the
ancient
and
less

con
ition
of

this
view
may
be
true
and

it
may
never
be
capable
of
full
proof
seeing
for
in

that
the
oldest

mammals
reptiles
and
fish
strictly
belong
to
their
own
proper
classes
though
some
of
these

forms
are
in
slight

less
distinet
from
each
other
than
are
the
typical
members
of

groups
at
the

it
would
be

to
look
for
animals
having
the
common
embryological
character
of
the

until
beds
far
beneath

of
which

where

since

that
long

the

that
the

from

all
the

leading

seem
to
me
simply
to
fol
low
on
the
theory
of

with
modification
through

we
can
thus
understand
how
it
is
that

how

do
not

change

yet
in

that
all
undergo

to

the
extinction
of

is
the
almost
inevitable
conse

under

that

these

or

not
withstanding
this
parallelism
in
the
conditions
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
how
widely
different
are
their
living
productions
in
the
southern
hemisphere
if
we
compare
large

of

in

analogous

could

second
great
fact
which
strikes
us
in
our
general
review
is
that
barriers
of
any
kind
or
obstacles
to
free
migration
are
related
in
close
and
important
manner
to
the
differences
between
the
productions
of
various
regions
we
see
this
in
the
great
difference
of
nearly
all
the
ter
restrial
productions
of
the
new
and
old
worlds
except
ing
in
the
northern
parts
where
the
land
almost
joins
and
where
under
slightly
different
climate
there
might
have
been
free
migration
for
the
northern
temperate
forms
as
there
now
is
for
the
strictly
arctic
productions
we
see
the
same
fact
in
the
great
difference
between
the
inhabit
ants
of
australia
africa
and
south
america
under
the
same
latitude
for
these
countries
are
almost
as
much
iso
lated
from
each
other
as
is
possible
on
each
continent
also
we
see
the
same
fact
for
on
the
opposite
sides
of
lofty
and
continuous
mountain-ranges
andp
of
great
deserts
and
sometimes
even
of
large
rivers
we
find
different
pro

though
as
mountain-chains
deserts
&c
are
not
as
impassal%e
or
likely
to
have
endured
so
long

the
differences
are

in
degree
to

we

counter
no

barriers
and
we
have
innumerable
islands
as
halting-places
until
after
travelling
over
hemisphere
we
come

the

over

we

to
the
eastern

of
the
pacific

on

third
great
fact
partly
included
in
the

is
the
affinity
of
the

of

the

the

are
essentially
american
we
may
look
back
to
past
ages
as
shown
in
the
last
chapter
and
we
find
american
types
then
prevalent
on
the
american
continent
and
in
the
american
seas
we
see
in
these
facts
some
deep
organic
bond
prevailin
throughout
space
and
time
over
the
same
areas
of
lan
and
water
and
independent
of
their
physical
conditions
the
naturalist
must
feel
little
curiosity
who
is
not
led
to
inquire
what
this
bond
is
this
bond
on
my
theory
is
simply
inheritance
that
cause
which
alone
as
far
as
we
positively
know
produces
organisms
quite
like
or
as
we
see
in
the
case
of
varieties
nearly
like
each
other
the
dissimilarity
of
the
inhab
itants
of
different
regions
may
be
attributed
to
modifica
tion
through
natural
selection
and
in
quite
subordinate
degree
to
the
direct
influence
of
different
physical
condi
tions
the
degree
of
dissimilarity
will
depend
on
the
mi
ation
of
the
more
dominant
forms
of
life
from
one
region
into
another
having
been
effected
with
more
or
less
ease
at
periods
more
or
less
remote
on
the
nature
and
num
ber
of
the
former
immigrants
and
on
their
action
and
reaction
in
their
mutual
struggles
for
life
the
relation
of
organism
to
organism
being
as
have
already
often
remarked
the
most
important
of
all
relations
us
the
high
importance
of

comes
into

widely-ranging
species
abounding
in
individuals
which
have
already
triumphed
over
many
competitors
in
their
own
widely-extended
homes
will
have
the
best
chance
of
seizing
on
new
%hwes
when
they
spread
into
new
countries
in
their
new-homes
they
will
be
exposed
to
new
conditions
and
will
frequent
undergo
further
modification
and
improvement
and
us
they
will
become
still
further
victorious
and
will
produce
groups
of
modified
descendants
on
this
principle
of
inheritance
with
modification
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
sections
of
eenen
whole
genera
and
even
fami
lies
are
confined
to
the
same
areas
as
is
so
commonly
and
notoriously
the
case
believe
as
was
remarked
in
the
last
chapter
in
no
law
of
necessary
development
as
the
variability
of
each
species
is
an
independent
roperty
and
will
be
taken
ad
vantage
of
by
natural
selection
only
so
far
as
it
profits
the
individual
in
its
complex
struggle
for
life
so
the
de
gree
of
modification
in
different
species
will
be
no
uniform
quantity
if
for
instance
number
of
species
which
stand
in
direct
competition
with
each
other
migrate
in
body
into
new
and
afterwards
isolated
country
they
will
be
little
liable
to
modification
for
neither
migration
nor
isolation
in
themselves
can
do
anything
these
prin
ciples
come
into
play
only
by
bringing
organisms
into
new
relations
with
each
other
and
in
lesser
degree
with
the
surrounding
physical
conditions
as
we
have
seen
in
the
last
chapter
that
some
forms
have
retained
nearly
the
same
character
from
an
enormously
remote
geological
period
so
certain
species
have
migrated
over
vast
spaces
and
have
not
become
tly
modified
on
these
views
it
is
obvious
that
the
several
species
of
the
same
genus
though
inhabiting
the
most
distant
uarters
of
the
world
must
origina,ﬁy
have
proceeded
rom
the
same
source
as
they
have
descended
from
the
same
progenitor
in
the
case
of
those
species
which
have
undergone
during
whole
geological
periods
but
little
mod
ification
there
is
not
much
ﬂimsty
in
believing
that
they
may
have
migrated
from
the
same
region

307
in§
the
vast
geographical
and
climatal
changes
which
will
have
supervened
since
ancient
times
almost
any
amount
of
migration
is
possible
but
in
many
other
cases
in
which
we
have
reagon
to
believe
that
the
species
of
genus
have
been
produced
within
comparative
cent
times
there
is
great
difficulty
on
this
head
it
is
also
obvious
that
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
though
now
inhabiting
distant
and
isolated
regions
must
have
proceeded
from
one
spot
where
their
parents
were
first
produced
for
as
explained
in
the
last
chapter
it
is
incredible
that
individuals
identically
the
same
should
ever
have
been
produced
through
natural
selection
from
parents
specifically
distinet
we
are
thus
brought
to
the
question
which
has
been
largely
discussed
by
naturalists
namely
whether
species
have
been
created
at
one
or
more
ponts
of
the
earth’s
surface
undoubtedly
there
are
very
many
cases
of
ex
treme
difficulty
in
understanding
how
the
same
species
could
fossibly
ave
migrated
from
some
one
point
to
the
several
distant
and
isolated
points
where
now
found
nevertbeless
the
simplicity
of
the
view
that
each
species
was
first
produced
within
single
region
captivates
the
mind
iﬁ)a
who
rejects
it
rejects
the
vera
causa
of
ordi
nary
generation
with
subsequent
migration
and
calls
in
the
agency
of
miracle
it
is
universally
admitted
that
in
most
cases
the
area
inhabited
by
species
is
continu
ous
and
when
plant
or
animal
inhabits
two
points
so
distant
from
each
other
or
with
an
interval
of
such
nature
that
the
space
could
not
be
easily
passed
over
by
migration
the
fact
is
given
as
something
remarkable
and
exceptional
the
capacity
of
migrating
across
the
sea
is
more
distinetly
limited
in
terrestrial
mammals
than
per
haps
in
any
other
organic
beings
and
accordingly
we
find
no
inexplicable
cases
of
the
same
mammal
inhabiting
distant
points
of
the
world
no
geologist
will
feel
any
difficulty
in
such
cases
as
great
britain
having
been
for
merly
united
to
europe
and
consequently
possessing
the
same
quadrupeds
but
if
the
same
species
can
be
pro
duced
at
two
separate
points
why
do
we
not
find
single
mammal

to
europe
and

the
conditions

are
nearly
the

so
that
multitude
of
european
animals
and
plants
have
be
come

in
america

australia
and
some
of
the
aboriginal
flnuts
are
identically
the
same
at
these
distant
points
of
the
northern
and

the
answer
as
believe
is
that
mammals
have
not
been
able
to
mig‘x:te
whereas
some
plants
from
their
varied
means
of
dispersal
have
migrated
across
the
vast
and
broken
interspace
the
and
striking
influence
which
barriers
of
every
kind
have
had
on
distribution
is
intelligible
only
on
the
view
that
the
great
majority
of
species
have
been
produced
on
one
side
alone
and
have
not
been
able
to
migrate
to
the
other
side
some
few
families
many
sub-families
very
many
genera
and
still
greater
number
of
sections
of
genera
are
confined
to
single
region
and
it
has
been
observed
by
several
natu
ralists
that
the
most
natural
genera
or
those
genera
in
which
the
species
are
most
closely
related
to
each
other
are
generally
local
or
confined
to
one
area
what
strange
anomaly
it
would
be
if
when
coming
one
step
lower
in
the
series
to
the
individuals
of
the
same
spe
cies
directly
opposite
rule
prevailed
and
species
were
not
local
but
had
been
produced
in
two
or
more
distinct
areas
hence
it
seems
to
me
as
it
has
to
many
other
natu
ralists
that
the
view
of
each
species
having
been
pro
duced
in
one
area
alone
and
having
subsequently
mi
grated
from
that
area
as
far
as
its
powers
of
migration
and
subsistence
under
past
and
present
conditions
per
mitted
is
the
most
probable
undoubtedly
many
cases
occur
in
which
we
cannot
explain
how
the
same
species
could
have
passed
from
one
point
to
the
other
but
the
geographical
and
climatal
changes
which
have
cer
tainly
occurred
within
recent
geological
times
must
have
interrupted
or
rendered
discontinuous
the
formerly
con
tinuous
range
of
many
species
so
that
we
are
reduced
to
consider
whether
the
exceptions
to
continuity
of
ran
are
8o
numerous
and
of
so
grave
nature
that
we
ought
to
give
up
the
belief
rendered
probable
by
general
con
siderations
that
each
species
has
been
produced
within
omar
xl}
single
oentres
of
creation
809
one
area
and
has
migrated
thence
as
far
it
could
it
would
be
hopelessly
tedious
to
discuss
all
the
exceptional
cases
of
the
same
species
now
living
at
distant
and
sep
arated
points
nor
do
for
moment
pretend
that
any
explanation
could
be
offered
of
many
such
cases
but
after
some
preliminary
remarks
discuss
few
of
the
most
striking
classes
of
facts
namely
the
existence
of
the
same
species
on
the
summits
of
distant
mountain
and
at
distant
points
in
the
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
and
secondly
gn
the
following
chapter
the
wide
distribution
of
fresh-water
productions
and
thirdly
the
occurrence
of
the
same
terrestrial
species
on
islands
and
on
the
mainland
though
separated
%y
hundreds
of
miles
of
open
sea
if
the
existence
of
the
same
species
at
dis
tant
and
isolated
points
of
the
earth’s
surface
can
in
many
instances
be
explained
on
the
view
of
each
species
having
migrated
from
single
birthplace
then
considering
our
ignorance
with
respect
to
former
climatal
and
geographi
cal
changes
and
various
occasional
means
of
transport
the
belief
that
this
has
been
the
universal
law
seems
to
me
incomparably
the
safest
in
discussing
this
subject
we
shall
be
enabled
at
the
same
time
to
consider
point
equally
important
for
us
namely
whether
the
geveral
distinct
species
of
genus
which
on
my
theory
have
all
descended
from
common
srogenitor
can
have
migrated
undergoingl
modification
uring
some
part
of
their
migration
from
the
area
inhab
ited
by
their
progenitor
if
it
can
be
shown
to
be
almost
invariably
the
case
that
region
of
which
most
of
its
in
habitants
are
closely
related
to
or
belong
to
the
same
genera
with
the
species
of
second
region
has
probably
received
at
some
former
period
immigrants
from
this
other
region
my
theory
will
be
strengthened
for
we
can
clear
ly
understand
on
the
principle
of

cases
of
this
nature
are
common
and
are
as
we
shall
hereafter
more
fully
see
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
independent
creation
this
view
of
the
relation
of

1n
one
region
to
those
in
another
does
not
differ
much
by
substituting
the
word
variety
for
species
from
that
lately
advanced
in
an
ingenious
paper
by
mr
wal
lace
in
which
he
concludes
that
every
species
has
come
into
existence
coincident
both
in

and

with
e’e—existing
closely
allied
ies
and

that
this
coincidence
he
attributes
to

with
modification
previous
remarks
on
single
and
multiple
centres
of
creation
do
not
directly
bear
on
another
a{lied
ques
tion,—namely
whether
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
have
descended
from
single
pair
or
single
her
maphrodite
or
whether
as
some
authors
suppose
from
many
individuals
simultaneously
created
with
those
or
ganic
beings
which
never
intercross
if
such
exist
the
species
on
my
theory
must
have
descended
from
suc
cession
of
improved
varieties
which
will
never
have
blended
with
other
individuals
or
varieties
but
will
have
supplanted
each
other
so
that
at
each
successive
of
modification
and
improvement
all
the
individuals
of
each
variety
will
have
descended
from
single
parent
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
namely
with
all
organisms
which
habitually
unite
for
each
birth
or
which
often
in
tercross
believe
that
during
the
slow
process
of
modifi
cation
the
individuals
of
the
species
will
have
been
kept
nearly
uniform
by
intercrossing
so
that
many
individ
uals
will
have
gone
on
simultaneously
changing
and
the
whole
amount
of
modification
will
not
have
been
due
at
each
stage
to
descent
from
single
parent
to
illustrate
what
mean
our
english
race-horses
differ
slightly
from
the
horses
of
every
other
breed
but
they
do
not
owe
their
difference
and
superiority
to
descent
from
any
single
pair
but
to
continued
care
in
selecting
and
training
many
in
dividuals
during
many
generations
before
discussing
the
three
classes
of
facts
which
have
selected
as
presenting
the
greatest

say
few
words
on

c
lyell
and

ably
treated
this

give
here
only
the
briefest

of
the
more
important
facts

shall
however
presently
have
to
discuss
this
branch
of
the
subject
in
some
detail
changes
of
level
in
the
land
must
also
have
been
highly
influential
narrow
isthmus
now
separates
two
marine
faunas
submerge
it
or
let
it
formerly
have
been
submeried
and
the
two
faunas
will
now
blend
or
may
formerly
have
blended
where
the
sea
now
extends
land
may
at
former
period
have
connected
islands
or
possibly
even
continents
together
and
thus
have
allowed
terrestrial
productions
to
pass
from
one
to
the
other
no
geologist
will
dispute
that
great
mutations
of
level
have
occurred
within
the
period
of
existing
or
anisms
edward
forbes
insisted
that
all
the
islands
in
atlantic
must
recently
have
been
connected
with
europe
or
africa
and
europe
likewise
with
america
other
authors
have
thus
hypothetically
bridged
over
every
ocean
and
have
united
almost
every
island
to
some
main
land
if
indeed
the
arguments
used
by
forbes
are
to
be
trusted
it
must
be
admitted
that
scarcely
single
island
exists
which
has
not
recently
been
united
to
some
conti
nent
this
view
cuts
the
gordian
knot
of
the
dispersal
of
the
same
species
to
the
most
distant
points
and
removes
many
difficulty
but
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
we
are
not
authorized
in
admitting
such
enormous
geograph
ical
changes
within
the
period
of
existing
species
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
abundant
evidence
of
great
oscillations
of
level
in
our
continents
but
not
of
such
vast
changes
in
their
position
and
extension
as
to
have
united
them
within
the
recent
period
to
each
other
and
to
the
several
intervening
oceanic
islands
freely
admit
the
former
existence
of
many
islands
now
buried
beneath
the
sea
which
may
have
served
as
halting
places
for
318
geographical
distribution
{cmar
xl
plants
and
for
many
animals
during
their
migration
in
the
coral-producing
oceans
such
sunken
islands
are
now
marked
as
i_believe
by
rings
of
coral
or
atolls
standing
over
them
whenever
it
is
fully
admitted
as
believe
1t
will
some
da{
be
that
each
species
has
proceeded
from
single
birthplace
and
when
in
the
course
of
time
we
know
something
definite
about
the
means
of
distribution
we
shall
be
enabled
to
speculate
with
security
on
the
former
extension
of
the
ljand
but
do
not
believe
that
it
will
ever
be
proved
that
within
the
recent
period
continents
which
are
now
quite
separate
have
been
continuously
or
almost
continuously
united
with
each
other
and
with
the
many
existing
oceanic
islands
several
facts
in
distribu
tion,—such
as
the
great
difference
in
the
marine
faunas
on
the
opposite
sides
of
almost
every
continent,—the
close
relation
of
the
tertiary
inhabitants
of
several
lands
and
even
seas
to
their
present
inhabitants,—a
certain
of
relation
as
we
ghall
hereafter
see
between
the
distri
bution
of
mammals
and
the
depth
of
the
sea,—these
and
other
such
facts
seem
to
me
opposed
to
the
admission
of
such
prodigious
geographical
revolutions
within
the
recent
period
as
are
necessitated
on
the
view
advanced
by
forbes
and
admitted
by
his
many
followers
the
nature
and
relative
proportions
of
the
inhabitants
of
oceanic
islands
likewise
seem
to
me
opposed
to
the
belief
of
their
former
continuity
with
continents
nor
does
their
almost
uni
versally
volcanic
composition
favour
the
admission
that
they
are
the
wrecks
of
sunken
continents
if
they
had
originally
existed
as
mountain-ranges
on
the
land
some
at
least
of
the
islands
would
have
been
formed
like
other
mountain-summits
of
granite
metamorphic
schists
old
fossiliferous
or
other
such
rocks
instead
of
consisting
of
mere
piles
of
volcanic
matter
must
now
say
few
words
on
what
are
called
acci
dental
means
but
which
more
properly
might
be
called
occasional
means
of
distribution
shall
here
confine
myself
to
plants
in
botanical
works
this
or
that
plant
is
stated
to
be
ill
adapted
for
wide
dissemination
but
for
transport
across
the
sea
the
greater
or
less
facilities
may
be
said
to
be
almost
wholly
unknown

tried
with
mr

even
known
how

germinated
after
an

of
28
days
and
few
survived
an
immersion
of
187
days
it
deserves
notice
that
certain
orders
were
far
more
affected
than
others
nine
leguminoss
were
tried
and
with
one
exception
all
resisted
the
salt-water
badly
seven
species
of
the
allied
orders
hydrophyllacess
and
polemoniacess
were
killed
by
month’s
immersion
for
convenience
sake
chiefly
tried
small
seeds
without
the
capsule
or
fruit
and
as
all
of
these
sank
in
few
days
they
could
not
be
floated
across
wide
spaces
of
the
sea
whether
or
not
they
were
injured
by
the
salt-water
afterwards
tried
some
larger
fruits

&c
and
some
of
these
floated
for
long
time
it
is
well
known
what
difference
there
is
in
the
buoyancy
of
green
and
seasoned
timber
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
floods
might
wash
down
plants
or
branches
and
that
these
might
be
dried
on
the
banks
and
then
by
fresh
rise
in
the
stream
be
washed
into
the
sea
hence
was
led
to
dry
stems
and
branches
of

with
ripe

and
to
place
them
on

water
majority
sank
quickly
but
some
which
whilst
green
floated
for
very
short
time
when
dried
floated
much
longer
for
instance
ripe
hazel-nuts
sank
immediately
but
when
dried
they
floated
for
90
days
and
afterwards
when
planted
they
germinated
an
asparagus
plant
with
ripe
berries
floated
for
238
days
when
dried
it
floated
for
85
days
and
the
seeds
afterwards
germinated
the
ripe
seeds
of
helosciadium
sank
in
two
days
when
dried

90

and
afterwards

altogether
out
of
the
94
dried

floated
for

and
some
of
the

floated
for

so
that
as

germinated
after

and
as
{3

but
not
all
the

species
as
in
the
foregoing
experiment
floated
after
being
dried
for
above
28
days
as
far
as
we
may
infer
anything
from
these
scanzy
facts
we
may
conclude
that
the
seeds
of
%%
plants
of
any
country
might
be
floated
by
sea-currents
during
28
daﬁ
and
would
retain
their
power
of
germination

johnston’s

atlas

on
this

the
seeds
of

belonging

one
country
might
be
floated
across
924
miles
of
sea
to
another
country
and
when
stranded
if
blown
to
fa
vourable
spot
by
an
inland
gale
they
would
germinate
subsequently
to
my
experiments
m
martens
tried
similar
ones
but
in
much
better
manner
for
he
placed
the
seeds
in
box
in
the
actnal
sea
so
that
they
were
alternately
wet
and
exposed
to
the
air
like
really
floating
lants
he
tried
98
seeds
mostly
different
from
mine
ut
he
chose
many
large
fruits
and
likewise
seeds
from
lants
which
live
near
the
sea
and
this
would
have
avoured
the
average
length
of
their
flotation
and
of
their
resistance
to
the
injurious
action
of
the
salt-water
on
the
other
hand
he
did
not
previously
dry
the
plants
or
branches
with
the
fruit
and
this
as
we
have
seen
would
have
caused
some
of
them
to
have
floated
much
longer
the
result
was
that
}3
of
his
seeds
floated
for
42
days
and
were
then
capable
of
germination
but
do
not
doubt
that
plants
exposed
to
the
waves
would
float
for
less
time
than
those
e;lotected
from
violent
movement
a8
in
our
experiments
erefore
it
would
perhaps
be
safer
to
assume
that
the
seeds
of
about
%%
plants
of
flora
after
having
been
dried
could
be
floated
across
space
of
sea
900
miles
in
width
and
would
then
germinate
the
fact
of
the
larger
fruits
often
floating
longer
than
the
small
is
interesting
as
plants
with
large
seeds
or
fruit
could
hardly
be
transported
by
any
other
means
and
alph
de
candolle
has
shown
that
such
plants
generally
have
restricted
ranges

may
be
occasionally

may

be
35

can
hardly
doubt
that
they
maust
occasionally
have
transported
seeds
from
one
part
to
another
of
the
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
as
suggested
by
lyell
and
during
the
glacial
period
from
one
part
of
the
now
temperate
regions
to
another
in
the
azores
from
the
large
number
of
the
species
of

common
to
europe
in
comparison
with
the

of
other
oceanic
islands
nearer
to
the

and
as
remarked
by
mr

c

from
the
somewhat
northern
character
of
the

during

glacial
epoch
at

sir
c
lyell
wrote
to
m
h
ept;))cinquire
wlzatrl?gr
he
had
obsezzed
erratic
boulders
on
these
islands
and
he
answered
that
he
had
found
large
fragments
of
granite
and
other
rocks
which
do
not
occur
in
the
archipelago
hence
we
may
safely
infer
that
icebergs
formerly
landed
their
rocky
bur
thens
on
the
shores
of
these
mid-ocean
islands
and
it
is
at
least
possible
that
they
may
have
brought
thither
the
seeds
of
northern
plants
considering
that
the
several
above
means
of
transport
and
that
several
other
means
which
without
doubt
remain
to
be
discovered
have
been
in
action
year
after
year
for
centuries
and
tens
of
thousands
of
years
it
would
think
be
marvellous
fact
if
many
plants
had
not
thus
become
widely
transported
these
means
of
transport
are
some
times
called
accidental
but
this
is
not
strictly
correct
the
currents
of
the
sea
are
not
accidental
nor
is
the
direc
tion
of
prevalent
gales
of
wind
it
should
be
observ
ed
that
scarcely
any
means
of
transport
would
c
seeds
for
very
great
distances
for
seeds
do
not
retain
their
vi
tality
when
exposed
for
great
length
of
time
to
the
action
of
sea-water
nor
could
they
be
ong
carried
in
the
crops
or
intestines
of
birds
these
means
however
would
suffice
for
occasional
transport
across
tracts
of
sea
some
hundred
miles
in
breadth
or
from
island
to
island
or
from
continent
to
neighbouring
island
but
not
from
one
distant
continent
to
another
the
floras
of
distant
conti
nents
would
not
by
such
means
become
mingled
in
any
great
degree
but
would
remain
as
distinct
as
we
now
see
them
to
be
the
currents
from
their
course
would
never
bring
seeds
from
north
america
to
britain
though
they
might
and
do
bring
seeds
from
the
west
indies
to
our
western
shores
where
if
not
killed
by
so
long
an
im
mersion
in
salt-water
they
could
not
endure
our
climate
almost
every
year
one
or
two
land-birds
are
blown
across
the
whole
atlantic
ocean
from
north
america
to
the
western
shores
of
ireland
and
england
but
seeds
could
be
transported
by
these
wanderers
only
by
one
means
namely
dirt
sticking
to
their
feet
which
is
in
itself
rare
accident
even
in
this
case
how
small
would
the
818
geographioal
distribution
omir
x1
chance
be
of
seed
falling
on
favourable
soil
and
coming
to
maturity#
but
it
would
be
great
error
to
that
because
well-stocked
island
like
great
britain
has
not
as
far
as
is
known
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove
this
received
within
the
last
few
centuries
through
occa
sional
means
of
transport
immigrants
from
europe
or
an
other
continent
that
poorly-stocked
island
thoug
standing
more
remote
from
the
mainland
would
not
re
ceive
colonists
by
similar
means
do
not
doubt
that
out
of
twenty
seeds
or
animals
transported
to
an
island
even
if
far
less
well-stocked
than
britain
scarcely
more
than
one
would
be
so
well
fitted
to
its
new
home
as
to
become
naturalised
but
this
as
it
seems
to
me
is
no
valid
argu
ment
against
what
would
be
effected
by
occasional
means
of
transport
during
the
long
lapse
of
geological
time
whilst
an
island
was
being
upheaved
and
formed
and
be
fore
it
had
become
fully
stocked
with
inhabitants
on
almost
bare
land
with
few
or
no
destructive
insects
or
birds
living
there
nearly
every
seed
which
chanced
to
arrive
would
be
sure
to
germinate
and
survive
dispersal
during
the
glacial
period.—the
identity
of
many
plants
and
animals
on
mountain-summits
sepa
rated
from
each
other
by
hundreds
of
miles
of
lowlands
where
the
alpine
species
could
not
possibly
exist
is
one
of
the
most
striking
cases
known
of
the
same
species
living
at
distant
points
without
the
apparent
possibility
of
their
having
migrated
from
one
to
the
other
it
is
indeed
remarkable
fact
to
see
so
many
of
the
same
plants
living
on
the
snowy
regions
of
the
alps
or
pyrenees
and
in
the
extreme
northern
parts
of
europe
but
it
is
far
more
re
markable
that
the
plants
on
the
white
mountains
in
the
united
states
of
america
are
all
the
same
with
those
of
labrador
and
nearly
all
the
same
as
we
hear
from
asa
gray
with
those
on
the
loftiest
mountains
of
europe
even
as
long
ago
as
1747
such
facts
led
gmelin
to
con
clude
that
the
same
species
must
have
been
independently
created
at
several
distinct
points
and
we
might
have
re
mained
in
this
same
belief
had
not
agassiz
and
others
called
vivid
attention
to
the
glacial
period
which
as
we
omar
xl
during
the
glaocial
period
819
shall
immediately
see
affords
simple
explanation
of
these
facts
we
have
evidence
of
almost
every
conceiv
able
kind
organic
and
inorganic
that
within
ve
recent
geological
period
central
europe
and
no
america
suffered
under
an
arctic
climate
the
ruins
of
house
burnt
by
fire
do
not
tell
their
tale
more
plainly
than
do
the
mountains
of
scotland
and
wales
with
their
scored
flanks
polished
surfaces
and
perche(i
boulders
of
the
icy
streams
with
which
their
valleys
were
lately
filled
so
greatly
has
the
climate
of
europe
changed
that
in
northern
italy
gigantic
moraines
left
by
old
glaciers
are
now
clothed
by
the
vine
and
maize
tiroughout
large
part
of
the
united
states
erratic
boulders
and
rocks
scored
by
drifted
icebergs
and
coast
ice
plainly
reveal
former
cold
period
he
former
influence
of
the
glacial
climate
on
the
dis
tribution
of
the
inhabitants
of
europe
as
explained
with
remarkable
clearness
by
edward
forbes
is
substantially
as
follows
but
we
shall
follow
the
changes
more
readily
by
supposing
new
glacial
period
to
come
slowly
on
and
t.hyen
pass
away
as
formerly
occurred
as
the
cold
came
on
and
as
each
more
southern
zone
became
fitted
for
arc
tic
beings
and
ill-fitted
for
their
former
more
temperate
inhabitants
the
latter
would
be
supplanted
and
arctic
productions
would
take
their
places
pfhe
inhabitants
of
the
more
temperate
regions
would
at
the
same
time
travel
southward
unless
they
were
stopped
by
barriers
in
which
case
they
would
perish
the
mountains
would
become
covered
with
snow
and
ice
and
their
former
alpine
in
habitants
would
descend
to
the
plains
by
the
time
that
the
cold
had
reached
its
maximum
we
should
have
uni
form
arctic
fauna
and
flora
covering
the
central
parts
of
europe
as
far
south
as
the
alps
and
pyrenees
and
even
stretc}iﬁng
into
spain
the
now
temperate
regions
of
the
united
states
would
likewise
be
covered
by
arctic
plants
and
animals
and
these
would
be
nearly
the
same
with
those
of
europe
for
the
present
circumpolar
inhabitants
which
we
suppose
to
have
everywhere
travelled
south
ward
are
remarkably
uniform
round
the
world
we
may
suppose
that
the
glacial
period
came
on
little
320
geographical
distribution
omr
xl
earlier
or
later
in
north
america
than
in
europe
so
will
the
southern
migration
there
have
been
little
earlier
or
later
but
this
will
make
no
difference
in
the
final
result
as
the
warmth
returned
the
arctic
forms
would
re
treat
northward
closely
followed
up
in
their
retreat
by
the
productions
of
the
more
temperate
regions
and
as
the
snow
melted
from
the
bases
of
the
mountains
the
arctic
forms
would
seize
on
the
cleared
and
thawed
ground
al
ways
ascending
higher
and
higher
as
the
warmth
in
creased
whilst
their
brethren
were
pursuing
their
north
ern
journey
hence
when
the
warmth
had
eﬂly
returned
the
same
arctic
species
which
had
lately
lived
in
body
together
on
the
gowlands
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
would
beleft
isolated
on
distant
mountain-summits
having
been
exterminated
on
all
lesser
heights
and
in
the
aretie
regions
of
both
hemispheres
thus
we
can
understand
the
identity
of
many
plants
at
points
so
immensely
remote
as
on
the
mountains
of
the
united
states
and
of
europe
we
can
thus
also
under
stand
the
fact
that
the
alpine
plants
of
each
mountain
range
are
more
especially
related
to
the
arctic
forms
living
due
north
or
nearly
due
north
of
them
for
the
migration
as
the
cold
came
on
and
the
re-migration
on
the
returning
warmth
will
generally
have
been
due
south
and
north
the
alpine
plants
for
example
of
scotland
as
remarked
by
mrl.)h
cp
watson
and
those
of
the
pyrenees
as
re
marked
by
ramond
are
more
especially
allied
to
the
lants
of
northern
scandinavia
those
of
the
united
tates
to
labrador
those
of
the
mountains
of
siberia
to
the
arctic
regions
of
that
country
these
views
grounded
as
they
are
on
the
perfectly
well-ascertained
occurrence
of
former
glacial
period
seem
to
me
to
explain
in
so
satisfactory
manner
the
present
distribution
of
the
al
pine
and
arctic
productions
of
europe
and
america
that
when
in
other
regions
we
find
the
same
species
on
distant
mountain-summits
we
may
also
conclude
without
other
evidence
that
colder
climate
permitted
their
former
migration
across
the
low
intervening
tracts
since
become
too
warm
for
their
existence
the
climate
since
the
glacial
period
has
ever
been
omr
xi
during
the
glacial
period
321
in
any
de
warmer
than
at
present
as
some
geologists
in
they
un%tree
states
believe
tophave
be(en
the
cag;o
chi{elﬂy
from
the
distribution
of
the
fossil
gnathodou}
then
the
arctic
and
temperate
productions
will
at
very
late
period
have
marched
little
further
north
and
subsequently
have
retreated
to
their
present
homes
but
have
met
with
no
satisfactory
evidence
with
respect
to
this
inter
calated
slightly
warmer
period
since
the
glacial
period
the
arctic
forms
during
their
long
southern
migration
and
re-migration
northward
will
have
been
exposed
to
nearly
the
same
climate
and
a8
is
especially
to
be
noticed
they
will
have
kept
in
body
together
consequentl
their
mutual
relations
will
not
gave%)een
much
disturbed
and
in
accordance
with
the
principles
inculcated
in
this
volume
they
will
not
have
been
liable
to
much
modifica
tion
but
with
our
alpine
productions
left
isolated
from
the
moment
of
the
returning
warmth
first
at
the
bases
and
ultimately
on
the
summits
of
the
mountains
the
case
will
have
been
somewhat
different
for
it
is
not
likely
that
all
the
same
arctic
species
will
have
been
left
on
mountain
ranges
distant
from
each
other
and
have
sur
vived
there
ever
since
they
will
also
in
all
probabilit
have
become
mingled
with
ancient
alpine
species
whi
must
have
existed
on
the
mountains
before
the
commence
ment
of
the
glacial
epoch
and
which
during
its
coldest
period
will
have
been
temporarily
driven
down
to
the
gi&ins
they
will
also
have
been
exposed
to
somewhat
ifferent
climatal
influepces
their
mutual
relations
will
thus
have
been
in
some
degree
disturbed
consequently
they
will
have
been
liable
to
modification
and
this
we
find
has
been
the
case
for
if
we
compare
the
present
alpine
plants
and
animals
of
the
several
great
european
mountain-ranges
though
very
many
of
the
species
are
identically
the
same
some
present
varieties
some
are
ranked
as
doubtful
forms
ang
some
few
are
distinct
yet
closely
allied
or
representative
species
in
illustrating
what
as
believe
actually
took
place
during
the
glacial
period
assumed
that
at
its
com
mencement
the
arctic
productions
were
as
uniform
round
the
polar
regions
as
they
are
at
the
present
day
but
the
892
geographioal
distribution
omr
xl
foregoing
remarks
on
distribution
apply
not
only
to
strict
arctxg:xiggrms
but
also
to
many
snb-arc{ic
and
tz
some
fev{
northern
temperate
forms
for
some
of
these
are
the
same
on
the
lower
mountains
and
on
the
plains
of
north
america
and
europe
and
it
may
be
reasonably
asked
how
account
for
the
necessary
degree
of
uniformity
of
the
sub-arctic
and
northern
temperate
forms
round
the
world
at
the
commencement
of
the
glacial
period
at
the
present
day
the
sub-arctic
and
northern
temperate
¥muctiom
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
are
separated
rom
each
other
by
the
atlantic
ocean
and
by
the
ex
treme
northern
part
of
the
pacific
during
the
glacial
eriod
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
ived
further
southwards
than
at
present
they
must
have
been
still
more
completely
separated
by
wider
spaces
of
ocean
believe
the
above
difficulty
may
be
surmounted
by
looking
to
still
earlier
changes
of
climate
of
an
oppo
site
nature
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
durin
the
newer
pliocene
period
before
the
glacial
epoch
an
whilst
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
were
specifically
the
same
as
now
the
climate
was
warmer
than
at
the
present
day
hence
we
may
suppose
that
the
or
ﬁanisms
now
living
under
the
climate
of
latitude
60°
uring
the
pliocene
period
lived
further
north
under
the
polar
circle
in
latitude
66°-67°
and
that
the
stricg{
arctic
productions
then
lived
on
the
broken
land
still
nearer
to
the
pole
now
if
we
look
at
globe
we
shall
see
that
under
the
polar
circle
there
is
almost
continuous
land
from
western
europe
throfigh
siberia
to
eastern
america
and
to
this
continuity
of
the
circumpolar
land
and
to
the
consequent
freedom
for
inter-migration
under
more
favourable
climate
attribute
the
necessary
amount
of
uniformity
in
the
sub-arctic
and
northern
tem
perate
productions
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
at
period
anterior
to
the
glacial
epoch
believing
from
reasons
before
alluded
to
that
our
continents
have
long
remained
in
nearly
the
same
relative
position
though
subjected
to
large
but
partial
oscillations
of
level
am
strongly
inclined
to
extend
the
above
view
and
to
infer
that
during
some
earlier
and
still
warmer
pe
cmar
xl
during
the
glacial
period
898
riod
such
as
the
older
pliocene
period
large
number
of
the
same
plants
and
animals
inhabited
the
almost
continu
ous
circumpolar
land
and
that
these
plants
and
animals
both
in
the
old
and
new
worlds
began
slowly
to
migrate
southwards
as
the
climate
became
less
warm
long
before
the
commencement
of
the
glacial
period
we
now
see
as
believe
their
descendants
mostly
in
modified
con
dition
in
the
central
parts
of
europe
and
the
united
states
on
this
view
we
can
understand
the
relationship
with
very
little
identity
between
the
productions
of
north
america
and
europe,—a
relationship
which
is
most
remarkable
considering
the
distance
of
the
two
areas
and
their
separation
by
the
atlantic
ocean
we
can
further
understand
the
singular
fact
remarked
on
by
several
ob
servers
that
the
productions
of
europe
and
america
during
the
later
tertiary
stages
were
more
closely
related
to
each
other
than
they
are
at
the
present
time
for
durin
these
warmer
periods
the
northern
parts
of
the
old
ang
new
worlds
will
have
been
almost
continuously
united
by
land
serving
as
bridge
since
rendered
impassable
by
cold
for
the
inter-migratton
of
their
inhabitants
during
the
slowly
decreasing
warmth
of
the
pliocene
period
as
soon
as
the
species
in
common
which
inhabited
the
new
and
old
worlds
migrated
south
of
the
polar
circle
they
must
have
been
completely
cut
off
from
each
other
this
separation
as
far
as
the
more
temperate
pro
ductions
are
concerned
took
place
long
ages
ago
and
as
the
plants
and
animals
migrated
southward
they
will
have
become
mingled
in
the
one
great
region
with
the
native
american
productions
and
have
had
to
compete
with

consequently
we

here
every-thing
favourable
for

more

than

with

on

on

of

hence
1t
has
come
that
when
we
compare
the
now
living
pro
ductions
of
the
temperate
regions
of
the
new

we
find
very

geographical

cmar

was
formerly
supposed
but
we
find
in
every
great
class
many
forms
which
some
naturalists
rank
as
geographical
races
and
others
as
distinct
species
and
host
of
cﬁoscly
allied
or
representative
forms
which
are
ranked
by
all
nat
uralists
as
sieciﬁcnlly
distinet
as
on

in

slow

migration
of

which
during

even
somewhat
earlier
period
was
nearly
uniform
along

o(p
the
pdlar
circle
will
account
on
the
theory
of
modification
for
many
closely
allied
forms
now
living
in
areas
completely
sun
dered
thus
think
we
can
understand
the
presence
of
many
existing
and
tertiary
representative
forms
on
the
eastern
and
western
shores
of
temperate
north
america
and
the
still
more
striking
case
of
many
closely
allied
crustaceans
as
described
in
dana’s
admirable
work
of
some
fish
and
other
marine
animals
in
the
mediterranean
and
in
the

of
japan,—areas
now
separated
by
con
tinent
and
by
nearly
hemisphere
of
equatorial

these
cases
of
relationship
without
identity
of
the
in

of

now
disjoined
and
likewise
of
the
past
and
present
inhabitants
of
the
temperate
lands
of
north
america
and
europe
are
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
creation
we
cannot
say
that
they
have
been
created
alike
in
correspondence
with
the
nearly
similar
physical
conditions
of
t?xe
areas
for
if
we
compare
for
instance
certain
parts
of
south
america
with
the
southern
conti

of
the

we
see
countries
closely
corre
sponding
in

their
physical
conditions
but
with
their
in

utterly
dissimilar
but
we
must
return
to

from

we

that

to
avoid
believing

it

some

analogous

coulti
be

similar
cases
occur
as
an
example
may
quote
remark
by
the
high
est
authority
prof
dana
that
it
is
certainly
wonderful
fact
that
new

should
have
closer
resemblance
in
its
crustacea
to
great
britain
its
antipode
than
to
any
other
part

sir

richardson
also
speaks
of
the
re-appearance
on

of

tas
mania
&c
of
northern
forms
of
fish
dr
hooker
in
forms
me
that
twenty-five
species
of
algs
are
common
to
new
zealand
and
to
europe
but
have
not
been
found
in
the
intermediate
tropical
seas
it
should
be
observed
that
the
northern
species
and
forms
found
in
the
southern
parts
of
the
southern
hemi
sphere
and
on
the
mountain-ranges
of
the
intertropical
regions
are
not
arctic
but
belong
to
the
northern
tempe
rate
zones
as
mr
h
c
watson
has
recently
remarked
in
receding
from
polar
towards
equatorial
latitudes
the
al},)ine
or
mountain
floras
really
become
less
and
less
arc
tic
many
of
the
forms
living
on
the
mountains
of
the
warmer
regions
of
the
earth
and
in
the
southern
hemi
sphere
are
of
doubtful
value
being
ranked
by
some
natu
828
geographical
distribution
crar
x1
ralists
as
specifically
distinct
by
others
as
varieties
but
some
are
certainly
identical
and
many
though
closely
related
to
northern
forms
must
be
ranked
as
distinct
species
now
let
us
see
what
light
can
be
thrown
on
the
fore
eoing
facts
on
the
belief
snplported
as
it
is
by
large
ody
of
geological
evidence
that
the
whole
world
or
large
part
of
it
was
during
the
glacial
period
simulta
neously
much
colder
than
at
present
the
glacial
period
as
measured
by
years
must
have
been
very
long
and
when
we
remember
over
what
vast
spaces
some
natural
ised
plants
and
animals
have
spread
within
few
centu
ries
this
period
will
have
been
ample
for
any
amount
of
migration
as
the
cold
came
slowly
on
all
the
tropical
plants
and
other
productions
will
have
retreated
from
both
sides
towards
the
equator
followed
in
the
rear
by
the
temperate
productions
and
these
by
the
arctic
but
with
the
latter
we
are
not
now
concerned
the
tropical
plants
probably
suffered
much
extinction
how
much
no
one
can
say
perhaps
formerly
the
tropics
supé)orted
as
many
species
as
we
see
at
the
present
day
crowded
together
at
cape
of
good
hope
and
in
parts
of
temperate
aus
stralia
as
we
know
that
many
tropical
plants
and
ani
mals
can
withstand
considerable
amount
of
cold
man
might
have
escaped
extermination
during
moderate
fall
of
temperature
more
especially
by
escaping
into
the
warmest
spots
but
the
great
fact
to
bear
in
mind
is
that
all
tropical
productions
will
have
suffered
to
cer
tain
extent
on
the
other
hand
the
temperate
produc
tions
after
migrating
nearer
to
the
equator
though
they
will
have
been
placed
under
somewhat
new
conditions
will
have
suffered
less
and
it
is
certain
that
many
tem
perate
plants
if
protected
from
the
inroads
of
competi
tors
can
withstand
much
warmer
climate
than
their
own
hence
it
seems
to
me
possible
bearing
in
mind
that
the
tropical
productions
were
in
suffering
state
and
could
not
have
presented
firm
front
against
intruders
that
certain
number
of
the
more
vigorous
and
dominant
temperate
forms
might
have
penetrated
the
native
ranks
and
have
reached
or
even
crossed
the
equator
the
in
omar

during
the

829
vasion
would
of
course
have
been
greatly
favoured
high
land
and
perhaps
by
dry
climate
for
dr
fal
coner
informs
me
that
it
is
the
damp
with
the
heat
of
the
tropics
which
is
so
destructive
to
perennial
plants
from
temperatc
climate
on
the
other
hand
the
most
humid
and
hottest
districts
will
have
afforded
an
asylum
to
the
tropical
natives
thé
mountain-ranges
north-west
of
the
himalaya
and
the
long
line
of
the
cordillera
seem
to
have
afforded
two
great
lines
of
invasion
and
it
is
striking
fact
lately
communicated
to
me
by
dr
hooker
that
all
the
flowering
plants
about
forty-six
in
number
common
to
tierra
del
uego
and
to
europe
still
exist
in
north
america
which
must
have
lain
on
the
line
of
march
but
do
not
doubt
that
some
temperate
produc
tions
entered
and
crossed
even
the
lowlands
of
the
tropics
at
the
period
when
the
cold
was
most
intense,—when
arc
tic
forms
had
migrated
some
twenty-five
degrees
of
lati
tude
from
their
native
country
and
covered
the
land
at
the
foot
of
the
pyrenees
at
this
period
of
extreme
cold
believe
that
the
climate
under
the
equator
at
the
level
of
the
sea
was
about
the
same
with
that
now
felt
there
at
the
height
of
six
or
seven
thousand
feet
during
this
the
coldest
period
suppose
that
large
spaces
of
the
tropical
lowlands
were
clothed
with
mingled
tropical
and
tem
ferata
vegetation
like
that
now
growing
with
strange
uxuriance
at
the
base
of
the
himalays
as
graphically
de
scribed
by
hooker
thus
as
believe
considerable
number
of
plants
few
terrestrial
animals
and
some
marine
productions
mi
grated
during
the
glacial
period
from
the
northern
and
southern
temperate
zones
into
the
intertropical
regions
and
some
even
crossed
the
equator
as
the
warmg
re
turned
these
temperate
forms
would
naturally
ascend
the
higher
mountains
being
exterminated
on
the
low
lands
those
which
had
not
reached
the
equator
would
re-migrate
northward
or
southward
towards
their
former
homes
but
the
forms
chiefly
northern
which
had
crossed
the
equator
would
travel
still
further
from
their
homes
into
the
more
temperate
latitudes
of
the
opposite
hemi
sphere
although
we
have
reason
to
believe
from
geo
830
geogratphical
distribution
{cmar
xy
logical
evidence
that
the
whole
body
of
arctic
shells
nunder
went
scarcely
any
modification
during
their
long
southern
migration
and
re-migration
northward
the
case
may
have
been
wholly
different
with
those
intruding
forms
which
settled
themselves
on
the
intertropical
mountains
and
in
the
southern
hemisphere
these
being
swrrounded
by
strangers
will
have
had
to
compete
with
many
new
forms
of
lit%e
and
it
is
probable
that
selected
moditications
in
their
structure
habits
and
constitutions
will
have
profited
them
thus
many
of
these
wanderers
though
still
plainly
related
by
inheritance
to
their
brethren
of
the
northern
or
southern
hemispheres
now
exist
in
their
new
homes
as
well-marked
varieties
or
as
distinct
species
it
is
remarkable
fact
strongly
insisted
on
by
hooker
in
regard
to
america
and
by
alph
de
candolle
in
re
gard
to
australia
that
many
more
identical
plants
and
allied
forms
have
apparently
migrated
from
the
north
to
the
south
than
in
reversed
direction
we
see
how
ever
few
southern
vegetable
forms
on
the
mountains
of
borneo
and
abyssinia
suspect
that
this
preponderant
migration
from
north
to
south
is
due
to
the
greater
extent
of
jand
in
the
north
and
to
the
northern
forms
having
existed
in
their
own
homes
in
greater
numbers
and
hav
ing
consequently
been
advanced
through
natural
selection
and
competition
to
higher
stage
of
perfection
or
domi
nating
power
than
the
southern
forms
and
thus
when
they
became
commingled
during
the
glacial
period
the
northern
forms
were
enabled
to
beat
the
less
powerful
southern
forms
just
in
the
same
manner
as
we
see
at
the
present
day
that
very
many
european
productions
cover
the
ground
in
la
plata
and
in
lesser
degree
in
australia
and
have
to
certain
extent
beaten
the
natives
whereas
extremely
few
southern
forms
have
become
nat
uralised
in
any
part
of
europe
though
hides
wool
and
other
objects
likely

cannot
hope

until
we
can
say
why
one

and
not
another
becomes
naturalised
by

in

why

some
of
the
most

are

me
to
indicate

am
inclined-to%ook
in

the

suspect
that
before
this

was
exterminated
by

few

were
widely
dispersed
to

by

by

perhaps
at

by

the
case
is

the

have

species
belonging

an
enormous

spe
cies
prevail
in
remarkable
manner
throughout

well
remember
when
first
collecting
in
the
fresh

of

feeling
much
surprise
at
the
simi
larity
of
the
fresh-water
insects
shells
&c
and
at
the
dissimilarity
of
the
surrounding
terrestrial
beings
com
pared
with
those
of
britain
but
this
power
in
fresh-water
productions
of
ranging
widely
though
so
unexpected
can
think
in
most
cases
be
explained
by
their
having
become
fitted
in

to
them
for
short

frequent

from

would
follow
from
this
capacity
as
an
almost

consequence
we
can
here
consider
only
few
cases
in

to

believe
that
the

never
occur

few
facts
seem
to
favour
the
possibility
of
their
occa
sional
transport
by
accidental
means
like
that
of
the
live
fish
not
rarely
dropped
by
whirlwinds
in
india
and
the
vitality
of
their
ova
when
removed
from
the
water
but
am
inclined
to
attribute
the
dispersal
of
fresh-water
fish
mainly
to
sliﬁht
changes
within
the
recent
period
in
the
level
of
the
land
having
caused
rivers
to
ii)iow
into
each
other
instances
also
could
be
given
of
this
having
occurred
during
floods
without
any
change
of
level
we
have
evidence
in
the
loess
of
the
rhine
of
considerable
changes
of
level
in
the
land
within
very
recent
geolog
ical
period
and
when
the
surface
was
peopled
by
existing
land
and
fresh-water
shells
the
wide
difference
of
the
fish
on
opposite
sides
of
continmous
mountain-ranges
which
from
an
early
period
must
have
parted
river-systems
and
completely
prevented
their
inosculation
seems
to
lead
to
this
same
conclusion
with
respect
to
allied
fresh
water
fish
occurring
at
very
distant
points
of
the
world
no
doubt
there
are
many
cases
which
cannot
at
present
be
explained
but
some
fresh-water
fish
belong
to
very
ancient
forms
and
in
such
cases
there
will
have
been
ample
time
for
great
geographical
changes
and
conse
quently
time
and
means
for
much
migration
in
the
second
place
salt-water
fish
can
with
care
be
slowly
accustomed
to
live
in
fresh
water
and
according
to
valenciennes
there
is
hardly
single
group
of
fishes
confined
exclusively
to
fresh
water
so
that
we
may
imagine
that
marine
member
of
fresh-water
group
might
travel
far
along
the
shores
of
the
sea
and
su%gequently
become
inogiﬁeg
and
adapted
to
the
fresh
waters
of
distant
and
some
species
of
fresh-water
shells
have
very
wide
range
and
allied
species
which
on
my
theory
are
de
scended
from
common
parent
and
must
have
proceeded
from
single
source
prevail
throughout
the
world
their
distribution
at
first
perplexed
me
much
as
their
ova
are
not
likely
to
be
transported
by
birds
and
they
are
imme
diately
killed
by
sea-water
as
are
the
adults
could
not
evén
understand
how
some
naturalised
epecies
have
836

crar
xil
rapidly
spread
throughout
the
same
country
but
two
facts
which
have
observed—and
no
doubt
many
others
remain
to
be
observed—throw
some
light
on
this
subject
when
duck
suddenly
emerges
from
pond
covered
with
duck-weed
have
twice
scen
these
little
plants
adhering
to
its
back
and
it
has
happened
to
me
in
removing
little
duck-weed
from
one
aquarium
to
another
that
have
xite
unintentionally
stocked
the
one
with
fresh-water
ells
from
the
other
but
another
agency
is
perhaps
more
effectual
suspended
duck’s
feet
which
might
represent
those
of
bird
sleeping
in
natural
pond
in
an
aquarium
where
many
ova
of
fresh-water
shells
were
hatching
and
found
that
numbers
of
the
extremely
minute
and
just
hatched
shells
crawled
on
the
feet
and
clung
to
them
so
firmly
that
when
taken
out
of
the
water
they
could
not
be
jarred
off
though
at
somewhat
more
advanced
age
they
would
voluntarily
drop
off
these
just
hatched
molluscs
though
aquatic
in
their
nature
survived
on
the
duck’s
feet
in
damp
air
from
twelve
to
twenty
hours
and
in
this
length
of
time
duck
or
heron
might
fly
at
least
six
or
seven
hundred
miles
and
would
be
sure
to
alight
on
pool
or
rivulet
if
blown
across
the
sea
to
an
oceanic
island
or
to
any
other
distant
point

that

it
might

flown

no

can

what
enormous
ranges
many
fresh-water

have
both

this
is

remarked

in

of

plants
which
have

seem

to
acquire

they
would
not

to

on

of

so
that
the

would
not
be
washed
off
their
feet
when
making
land
they
would
be
sure
to
fly
to
their
natural
fresh-water
haunts
do
not
believe
that
botanists
are
aware
how
char%ed
the
mud
of
ponds
is
with
seeds
have
tried
several
little
experiments
but
will
here
give
only
the
most
striking
case
took
in
feb
ruary
three
table-spoonfuls
of
mud
from
three
different
points
beneath
water
on
the
edge
of
little
pond
this
mud
when
dry
weighed
only
6%
ounces
kept
it
covered
up
in
my
study
for
six
months
pulling
up
and
countin
each
plant
as
it
grew
the
plants
were
of
many
kinds
an
were
altogether
537
in
number
and
yet
the
viscid
mud
was
all
contained
in
breakfast
cup
~considering
these
facts
think
it
would
be
an
inexplicable
circumstance
if
water-birds
did
not
transport
the
seeds
of
fresh-water
plants
to
vast
distances
and
if
consequently
the
range
of
these
plants
was
not
very
great
the
same
agency
may
have
come
into
play
with
the
eggs
of
some
of
the
smaller
fresh-water
animals
other
and
unknown
agencies
probably
have
also
played
part
have
stated
that
fresh-water
fish
eat
sowe
kinds
of
seeds
though
they
reject
many
other
kinds
after
having
swallowed
them
even
small
fish
swallow
seeds
of
moderate
size
as
of
the
yellow
water-lily
and
potamogeton
herons
and
other
birds
century
after
century
have
gone
ou
daily
devouring
fish
they
then
take
flight
and
go
to
other
waters
or
are
blown
across
the
sea
and
we
have
seen
that
seeds
retain
their
power
of
germination
when
rejected
in
pellets
or
in
excrement
many
hours
afterwards
when
saw
the
great
size
of
the
seeds
of
that
fine
water-lily
the
nelumbium
and
re
membered
alph
de
candolle’s
remarks
on
this
plant
thought
that
its
distribution
must
remain
quite
inexplica
ble
gbut
audubon
states
that
he
found
the
seeds
of
the
838
geographioal
distribution
omar
xil
southern
water-lily
probably
according
to
dr
e(;‘:ker
the
nelumbium
luteum
in
heron’s
stomach
although
do
not
know
the
fact
t{et
analogy
makes
me
believe
that
heron
flying
to
another
pond
and
getting
hearty
meal
of
fish
would
probably
reject
from
its
stom
ach
pellet
containing
the
seeds
of
the
nelumbium
un
digested
or
the
might
be
dropped
by
the
bird
whilst
feeding
its
young
in
the
same
way
as
fish
are
known
sometimes
to
be
dropped
in
considering
these
several
means
of
distribution
it
should
be
remembered
that
when
pond
or
stream
is
first
formed
for
instance
on
rising
islet
it
will
be
unocen
pied
and
single
seed
or
egg
will
have
good
chance
of
succeeding
although
there
will
always
be
struggle
for
life
between
the
individuals
of
the
species
however
few
already
occupying
any
pond
yet
as
the
number
of
kinds
is
small
compared
with
those
on
the
land
the
com
petition
will
probably
be
less
severe
between
aquatic
than
between
terrestrial
species
consequently
an
intrnd
er
from
the
waters
of
foreign
country
would
have
better
chance
of
seizing
on
place
than
in
the
case
of
terrestrial
colonists
we
should
also
remember
that
some
perhaps
many
fresh-water
productions
are
low
in
the
scale
of
nature
and
that
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
such
low
beings
change
or
become
modified
less
3:1ickly
than
the
high
and
this
will
give
longer
time
an
the
averaee
for
the
migration
of
the
same
aquatic
species
we
should
not
forget
the
probability
of
many
species
having
fomerly
ranged
as
continuously
as
fresh
water
productions
ever
can
range
over
immense
areas
and
having
subsequently
become
extinet
in
intermediate
regions
but
the
wide
distribution
of
fresh-water
plants
and
of
the
lower
animals
whether
retaining
the

identical
form
or
in
some
degree
modified
believe
main
ly
depends
on
the
wide
dispersal
of
their
seeds
and

by
animals
more
e:pecially
by
fresh-water

whi
have

islands.—we
now
come
to
the
last
of
the
three
classes
of
facts
which
have
selected
as
presenting
the
greatest
amount
of
difficulty
on
the
view
that
all
the
individuals
both
of
the
same
and
of
allied
species
have
descended
from
single
parent
and
therefore
have
all
proceeded
from
common
birthplace
notwithstanding
that
in
the
course
of
time
they
have
come
to
inhabit
distant
points
of
the
globe
have
already
stated
that
cannot
honestly
admit
forbes’s
view
on
con
tinental
extensions
which
if
legitimately
followed
out
would
lead
to
the
belief
that
within
the
recent
period
all
existing
islands
have
been
nearly
or
quite
joined
to
some
continent
this
view
would
remove
many
difficulties
but
it
would
not
think
explain
all
the
facts
in
regard
to
insular
productions
in
the
following
remarks
shall
not
confine
myself
to
the
mere
question
of
dispersal
but
shall
consider
some
other
facts
which
bear
on
the
truth
of
the
two
theories
of
independent
creation
and
of
descent
with
modification
the
species
of
all
kinds
which
inhabit
oceanic
islands
are
few
in
number
compared
with
those
on
equal
conti
nental
areas
alph
de
candolle
admits
this
for
plants
and
wollaston
for
insects
if
we
look
to
the
large
size
and
varied
stations
of
new
zealand
extending
over
780
miles
of
latitude
and
compare
its
flowering
plants
only
750
in
number
with
those
on
an
equal
arca
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
or
in
australia
we
must
think
admit
that
something
quite
independently
of
any
difference
in
physical
conditions
has
caused
so
great
difference
in
number
even
the
uniform
county
of
cambridge
has
847
plants
and
the
little
island
of
anglesea
764
but
few
ferns
and
few
introduced
plants
are
included
in
these
numbers
and
the
comparison
in
some
other
respects
is
not
quite
fair
we
have
evidence
that
the
barren
island
of
ascension
aboriginally
possessed
under
half-a-dozen
flow
ering
plants
yet
many
have
become
naturalised
on
it
as
they
have
on
new
zealand
and
on
every
other
oceanic
island
which
can
be
named
in
st
helena
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
naturalised
plants
and
animals
have
nearly
or
quite
exterminated
many
native
productions

cur
xt0
he
who
admits
the
doctrine
of
the
creation
of
each
sepa
rate
epecies
will
have
to
admit
that
sufficient
number
of
the
best
adapted
plauts
and
animals
have
not
been
created
on
oceanic
islands
for
man
has
unintentionally
stocked
them
from
various
sources
far
more
fully
and
per
fectly
than
has
nature
lthough
in
oceanic
islands
the
number
of
kinds
of
inhabitants
is
scanty
the
proportion
of
endemic
species
(
e
those
found
nowhere
else
in
the
world
is
often
ex
tremely
large
if
we
compare
for
instance
the
number
of
the
endemic
land-shells
in
madeira
or
of
the
endemic
birds
in
the
galapagos
archipelago
with
the
number
found
on
any
continent
and
then
compare
the
area
of
the
islands
with
that
of
the
continent
we
shall
see
that
this
is
true
this
fact
might
have
been
expected
on
my
theory
for
as
already
explained
species
occasionally
arriving
after
long
intervals
in
new
and
isolated
district
and
having
to
compete
with
new
associates
will
be
eminently
liable
to
modification
and
will
often
produce
groups
of
modified
descendants
but
it
by
no
means
follows
that
because
in
an
island
nearly
all
the
species
of
one
class
are
peculiar
those
of
another
class
or
of
another
section
of
the
same
class
are
peculiar
and
this
difference
seems
to
depend
on
the
spe
cies
which
do
not
become
modified
having
immigrated
with
facility
and
in
body
so
that
their
mutual
relations
have
not
been
much
disturbed
and
partly
on
the
frequent
arrival
of
unmodified
immigrants
from
the
mother-country
and
the
consequent
intercrossing
with
them
with
re
spect
to
the
effects
of
this
intercrossing
it
should
be
re
membered
that
the
offspring
of
such
crosses
would
almost
certainly
gain
in
vigour
so
that
even
an
occasional
cross
would
produce
more
effect
than
might
at
first
have
been
anticipated
to
give
few
examples
in
the
galapagos
islands
there
are
twenty-six
land-birds
of
these
twenty
one
or
perhaps
twenty-three
are
peculiar
whereas
of
the
eleven
marine
birds
only
two
are
peculiar
and
it
is
ob
vious
that
marine
birds
could
arrive
at
these
islands
more
easily
thanland-birds
bermuda
on
the
other
hand
which
lies
at
about
the
same
distance
from
north
america
as
the
galapagos
islands
do
from
south
america
and
which
has
very
peculiar

not
possess

84
land-bird
and
we
know
from
mr
j
m
jones’s
admira
ble
account
of
bermuda
that
very
many
north
american
birds
during
their
great
annual
migrations
visit
either
periodically
or
occasionally
this
island
madeira
does
not
possess
one
peculiar
bird
and
many
european
and
african
birds
are
almost
every
year
blown
there
as
am
informed
by
mr
e
v
harcourt
so
that
these
two
islands
of
bermuda
and
madeira
have
been
stocked
by
birds
which
for
long
have
struggled
together
in
their
former
homes
and
have
become
mutually
adapted
to
each
other
and
when
settled
in
their
new
homes
each
kind
will
have
been
kept
by
the
others
to
their
proper
laces
and
habits
and
will
consequently
have
been
little
iable
to
modification
madeira
again
is
inhabited
by
wonderful
number
of
peculiar
land-shells
whereas
not
one
species
of
sea-shell
is
confined
to
its
shores
now
though
we
do
not
know
how
sea-shells
are
dispersed
yet
we
can
see
that
their
eggs
or
larvee
perhaps
attached
to
seaweed
or
floating
timber
or
to
the
feet
of
wading-birds
might
be
transported
far
more
easily
than
land-shells
across
three
or
four
hundred
miles
of
open
sea
the
different
orders
of
insects
in
madeira
apparently
present
analogous
facts
oceanic
islands
are
sometimes
deficient
in
certain
classes
and
their
places
are
apparently
occupied
by
the
other
inhabitants
in
the
galapagos
islands
reptiles
and
in
new
zealand
gigantic
wingless
birds
take
the
place
of
mammals
in
the
plants
of
the
galapagos
islands
dr
hooker
has
shown
that
the
proportional
numbers
of
the
different
orders
are
very
different
from
what
they
are
elsewhere
such
cases
are
generally
accounted
for
by
the
physical
conditions
of
the
islands
but
this
explana
tion
seems
to
me
not
little
doubtful
facility
of
immi
gration
believe
has
been
at
least
as
important
as
the
nature
of
the
conditions
many
remarkable
little
facts
could
be
given
with
re
spect
to
the
inhabitants
of
remote
islands
ior
instance
in
certain
islands
not
tenanted
by
mammals
some
of
the
endemic
plants
have
beautifully
hooked
seeds
{et
few
relations
are
more
striking
than
the
adaptation
of
hooked
seeds
for
transportal
by
the
wool
and
fur
of
quadrupeds
this
case
presents
no
difficulty
on
my
view
for
hooked

geographical
distribution
cuar
x1
seed
might
be
transported
to
an
island
by
some
other
means
and
the
plant
then
becoming
slightly
modified
but
still
retaining
its
hooked
seeds
would
form
an
en
demic
specics
having
as
useless
an
appendage
as

dimentary

instance
as

of

or

now
trees
as

generally
have
whatever
the
cause
may
be

ranges
hence
trees
would
be
little
likely
to
reach
distant
oceanic
islands
and
an
herbaceous
plant
though
it
would
have
no
chance
of
successfully
competing
in
stature
with
fully
developed
tree
when
establisﬂed
on
an
island
and
having
to
com
pete
with
herbaceous
plants
alone
might
readily
gain
an
advantage
by
growing
taller
and
taller
and
overtopping
the
other
plants
if
so
natural
selection
would
often
ten
to
add
to
the
stature
of
herbaceous
plants
when
growi
on
an
island
to
whatever
order
they
belonged
and
thus
convert
them
first
into
bushes
and
ultimately
into
trees
with
respect
to
the
absence
of
whole
orders
on
oceanic
islands
bory
st
vincent
long
ago
remarked
that
batra
chians
frogs
toads
newts
have
never
been
found
on
an
of
the
many
islands
with
which
the
great
oceans
are
stud
ded
have
taken
pains
to
verify
this
assertion
and
have
found
it
strictly
true
have
however
been
as
sured
that
frog
exists
on
the
mountains
of
the
great
island
of
new
zealand
but
suspect
that
this
exception
if
the
information
be
cox'reci:)1
may
be
explained
through
glacial
agency
this
general
absence
of
frogs
toads
and
newts
on
80
many
oceanic
islands
cannot
be
accounted
for
by
their
physical
conditions
indeed
it
seems
that
islands
are
peculiarly
well
fitted
for
these
animals
for
frogs
have
been
introduced
into
madeira
the
azores
and
mauri
tius
and
have
multiplied
s0o
as
to
become
nuisance
but
as
these
animals
and
their
spawn
are
known
to
be
immediately
killed
by
sea-water
on
my
view
we
can
see
that
there
would
be
great
difficulty
in
their
transportal
across
thé
sea
and
therefore
why
they
do
not
exist
on
any
oceanic
island
but
why
on
the
theory
of
creation
they
caar
xil
oceanic
islands
3843
should
not
have
been
created
there
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
explain

offer
another
and
similar
case
have
cure
fully
searched
the
oldest
voyages
but
have
not
finished
my
search
as
yet
have
not
found
single
instance
free
from
doubt
of
terrestrial
mammal
excluding
domesti
cated
animals
kept
by
the
natives
inhabiting
an
island
situated
above
300
miles
from
continent
or
great
con
tinental
island
and
many
islands
situated
at
much
less
distance
are
equally
barren
the
falkland
islands
which
are
inhabited
by
wolf-like
fox
come
nearest
to
an
excep
tion
but
this
group
cannot
be
considered
as
oceanic
as
it
lies
on
bank
connected
with
the
mainland
moreover
icebergs
formerly
brought
boulders
to
its
western
shores
and
they
may
have
formerly
transported
foxes
as
so
fre
quently
now
hag})ens
in
the
arctic
regions
yet
it
cannot
be
said
that
small
islands
will
not
support
small
mammals
for
they
occur
in
many
parts
of
the
world
on
very
small
islands
if
close
to
continent
and
hardly
an
isla.nlgcan
be
named
on
which
our
smaller
quadrupeds
have
not
become
naturalised
and
greatly
multiplied
it
cannot
be
said
on
the
ordinary
view
of
creation
that
there
hasnot
been
time
for
the
creation
of
mammals
many
volcanic
islands
are
sufficiently
ancient
as
shown
by
the
stupendous
degrada
tion
which
they
have
suffered
and
by
their
tertiary
strata
there
has
also
been
time
for
the
production
of
endemic
fecies
belonging
to
other
classes
and
on
continents
it
is
hought
that
mammals
appear
and
disa'fﬁear
at
quicker
rate
than
other
and
lower
animals
ough
terrestrial

not

occur

yy
it
may
be
asked
has
the
supposed
creative
force
produced
bats
and
no
other
mammals
on
remote
islands
on
my
view
this
question
can
easily
be
answered
for
no
terrestrial
mammal
can
be
transported
across
wide
space
of
sea
but
bats
can
fly
across

at

hear
from
mr
tomes
who
has
specially
studied
this
family
that
many
of
the
same
spe
cies
have
enormous
ranges
and
are
found
on
continents
and
on
far
distant
islands
hence
we
have
only
to
sup
pose
that
such
wandering
sﬁecies
have
been
modified
through
natural
selection
1n
their
new
homes
in
relation
to
their
new
position
and
we
can
understand
the
presence
of
endemic
bats
on
islands
with
the
absence
of
all
terres
trial
mammals
besides
the
absence
of
terrestrial
mammals
in
relation
to
the
remoteness
of
islands
from

there
is
also
rclation
to
certain
extent
independent.of

between
the
depth
of
the

separating
an

from
the

and
the

of
the

mammiferousspecies

of

species
in
more
or
less
modified
condition
mr
windsor
earl
has
made
some
striking
obgervations
on
this
head
in
regard
to
the
erea.t
malay
archipelago
which
is
traversed
near

of

this
sgace
separates

distinet

the

situated
on
moderately
steep
submarine
banks
and
they
are
inhabited
by
closely
allied
or
identical
quadrupeds
no
doubt
some
few
anomalies
occur
in
this
great
archipelago
and
there
is
much
difficulty
in
formin
judgment
in
some
cases
owing
to
the
probable
naturali
sation
of
certain
mammals
through
man’s
agency
but
we
shall
soon
have
much
light
thrown
on
the
natural
history
of
this
archipelago
by
the
admirable
zeal
and
researches
of
mr
wallace
have
not
as
yet
had
time
to
follow
up
this
subject
in
all
other
quarters
of
the

but
as
far
as
have
gone
the
relation
a%lenemlly
holds
good
we
see
britain
separated
by
shallow
channel
from
europe
and
the
mammals
are
the
same
on
both
sides
we
meet
with
analogous
facts
on
many

the
west

stand
on
deeply
submerged

nearly
1000
fathoms
in

and
here
we
find
american
forms
but
the
species
and
even
the
genera
are
distinct
as
the
amount
of
modification
in
all
cases
depends
to
certain
degree
on
the
lapse
of

and
as

it
is
obvious
that
islands
separated
by
shallow

are
more
likely
to
have
been
continuously
united
within
recent
period
to
the
mainland
than
islands
sepa
rated
by

we
can
understand
the
frequent
relation
between
the
depth
of
the
sea
and
the
degree
of
affinity
of
the
mammalian
inhabitants
of
islands
with
those
of
neighbouring
continent,—an
inexplicable
rela
tion
on
the
view
of
independent
acts
of
creation
all
the
foregoing
remarks
on
the
inhabitants
of
oceanic
islands,—-namcf
the
scarcity
of
kinds,—the
richness
in
endemic
forms
in
particular
classes
or
sections
of
classes
the
absence
of
whole
groups
as
of
batrachians
and
of
terrestrial
mammals
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
aérial
bats,—the
singular
proportions
of
certain
orders
of
plants
herbaceous
forms
having
been
developed
into
trees
&c.,—seem
to
me
to
accord
better
with
the
view
of
occa
sional
means
of
transport
having
been
largely
efficient
in
the
long
course
of
time
than
with
the
view
of
all
our
oceanic
islands
having
been
formerly
connected
by
con
tinuous
land
with
the
nearest
continent
for
on
this
latter
view
the
migration
would
probably
have
been
more
com
lete
and
it
modification
be
admitted
all
the
forms
of
efe
would
have
been
more
equally
modified
in
accord
ance
with
the
paramount
importance
of
the
relation
of

ganism
to
organism
donot
deny
that
there
are
many
and
grave
difficulties
in
understanding
how
several
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
more
remote
islands
whether
still
retaining
the
same
spe
cific
form
or
modified
since
their
arrival
could
have
reached
their
present
homes
but
the
probability
of
many
islands
having
existed
as
halting-places
of
which
not
wreck
now
remains
must
not
be
overlooked
will
here
give
single

of
one
of
the
cases
of
diffi
culty
almost
all
oceanic

even
the
most
isolated

by
land-shells

by

sometimes
by

has
given
several
interesting
cases
in

to
the
land-shelfs
of
the

it

notorious
that
land-shells

some
unknown
but
highly
efficient
means
for
their
transportal
would
the
just-hatched
young
occasionally
crawl
on
and
adhere
to
the
feet
of
birds
roosting
on
the
und
and
thus
iet
transported
it
occurred
to
me
that
and-shells
when
hybernating
and
having
membranous
diaphragm
over
the
mouth
of
the
shell
might
be
floated
in
chinks
of
drifted
timber
across
moderatgly
wide
arms
of
the
sea
and
found
that
several
species
did
in
this
state
withstand
uninjured
an
immersion
in
sea-water
dur
ing
seven
days
one
of
these
shells
was
the
helix
poma
tia
and
after
it
had
again
hybernated
put
it
in
sea-water
for
twenty
days
and
it
perfectly
recovered
as
thisspecies
has
athic{

removed
it
and
when
it
had
formed
new
membranous
one
immersed
it
for
fourteen
days
in
sea-water
and
it
recovered
and
crawled
away
but
more
experiments
are
wanted
on
this
head
the
most
striking
and
important
fact
for
us
in
regard
to
the
inhabitants
of
islands
is
their
affinity
to
those
of
the
nearest
mainland
without
being
actually
the
same
species
numerous
instances
could
be
given
of
this
fact
will
give
only
one
that
of
the
galapagos
archipelago
situated
under
the
equator
between
500
and
600
mnﬁes
from
the
shores
of
south
america
here
almost
every
product
of
the
land
and
water
bears
the
unmistakeable
stamp
of
the
american
continent
there
are
twenty-six
land-birds
and
twenty-one
or
perhaps
twenty-three
of
these
are
ranked
as
distinct
species
and
are
supposed
to
have
been
created
here
yet
the
close
affinity
of
most
of
these
birds
to
american
species
in
every
character
in
their
habits
gestures
and
tones
of
voice
was
manifest
so
it
is
with
the
other
animals
and
with
nearly
all
the
plants
as
shown
by
dr
hooker
in
his
admirable
memoir
on
the
flora
of
this
archipelago
the
naturalist
looking
at
the
inhabi
tants
of
these
volcanic
islands
in
the
pacific
distant
several
hundred
miles
from
the
continent
yet
feels
that
he
is
stand
ing
on
american
land
why
should
this
be
so
why
should
the
species
which
are
supposed
to
have
been
created
in
the
galapagos
archipelago
and
nowhere
else
bear
so
plain
stamp
of
affinity
to
those
created
in
america
there
is
nothing
in
the
conditions
oflife
in

in
fact
there
is
considerable

in

otber

there
is

what
an

and
absolute
difference
in

the
inhabitants
of
the

islands
are
related
to
those
of

like
those
of
the
galapagos
to
america
believe
this
grand
fact
can
receive
no
sort
of
explanation
on
the
ordinary
view
of
independent
creation
whereas
on
the
view
here
maintained
it
is
obvious
that
the
gala%ngos
islands
would
be
likely
to
receive
colonists
whether
by
occasional
means
of
transport
or
by
formerly
continuous
land
from
america
and
the
cape
de
verde
islands
from
africa
and
that
such
colonists
would
be
liable
to
modification
the
principle
of
inheritance
still
betrﬁying
their
original
birthplace
any
analogous
facts
could
be
given
indeed
it
is
an
almost
universal
rule
that
the
endemic
productions
of
islands
are
related
to
those
of
the
nearest
continent
or
of
other
near
islands
the
exceptions
are
few
and
most
of
them
can
be
explained
thus
the
plants
of
kerguelen
land
though
standing
nearer
to
africa
then
to
america
are
related
and
that
very
closely
as
we
know
from
dr
hooker’s
account
to
those
of
america
but
on
the
view
that
this
island
has
been
mainly
stocked
by
geeds
brought
with
earth
and
stones
on
icebergs
drifted
by

prevail
ing

new

in

endemic
plants
is
much
more
closely
related
to
austra
lia

nearest
mainland
than
to
any
other
region
and
this
is
what
might
have
been
expected
but
it
is
also
plainly
related
to
south
america
which
although
the
next
nearest
continent
is
so
enormously
remote
that
the
fact
becomes
an
anomaly
but
this
difficulty
almost
disap
pears
on
the

that

the
affinity
which
though
feeble
am
assured
by
dr
hooker
is
real
between
the
flora
of
the
south-western
corner
of
australia
and
of
the
cape
of
good

is
far
more
remarkable
case
and
is
at
present
inexplicable
but
this
affinity
is
confined
to
the
plants
and
will
do
not
doubt
be
some
daz
explained
the
law
which
causes
the
inhabitants
of
an
archi
pelago
though
specifically
distinct
to
be
closely
allied
to
ose
of
the
nearest
continent
we
sometimes
see
displayed
on
small
scale
yet
in
most
interesting
manner
m&m
the
limits
of
the
same
archipelago
us
the
several
islands
of
the
galapagos
archipelago
are
tenanted
as
have
elsewhere
shown
in
quite
marvellous
manner
by
closely
related
species
so
that
the
inhabitants
of
each
separate
island
though
most
distinct
are
related
in
an
incomparably
closer
degree
to
each
other
than
to
the
inhabitants
of
any
other
part
of
the
world
and
this
is
just
what
might
have
been
expected
on
my
view
for
the
1slands
are
situated
so
near
each
other
that
they
would
almost
certainly
receive
immigrants
from
the
same
origi
nal
source
or
from
each
other
but
this
dissimilarity
between
the
endemic
inhabitants
of
the
islands
may
be
used
as
an
argument
against
my
views
for
it
may
be
asked
how
has
it
happened
in
the
several
islands
situated
within
sight
of
each
other
baving
the
same
geological
nature
the
same
height
climate
&c
that
many
of
the
immigrants
should
have
been
differently
modiﬂedf
though
only
in
small
degree
this
long
appeared
to
me
great
difticulty
but
it
arises
in
chief
part
from
the
deeply
seated
error
of
considering
the
physical
conditions
of
country
as
the
most
important
for
its
inhabitants
where
a8
it
cannot
think
be
disputed
that
the
nature
of
the
other
inhabitants
with
which
each
has
to
compete
is
at
least
as
important
and
generally
far
more
important
element
of
success
now
if
we
look
to
those
inhabitants
of
the
galapagos
archipelago
which
are
found
in
other
parts
of
the
world
laying
on
one
side
for
the
moment
the
endemic
species
which
cannot
be
here
fairly
included
as
we
are
considering
how
they
have
come
to
be
modified
since
their
arrival
we
find
considerable
amount
of
difference
in
theseveral
islands
this
difference
might
indeed
have
been
cmar

expected
on
the
view
of
the
islands
having
been
stocked
by
occasional
means
of
transport—a
seed
for
instance
of
one
plant
having
been
brought
to
one
island
and
that
of
another
plant
to
another
island
hence
when
in
former
times
an
immigrant
settled
on
any
one
or
more
of
the
islands
or
when
it
subsequently
spread
from
one
island
to
another
it
would
undoubtedly
be
exposed
to
different
conditions
of
life
in
the
different
islands
for
it
would
have
to
compete
with
different
sets
of
organisms
plant
for
instance
would
find
the
best-fitted
ground
more
perfectly
occupied
by
distinet
plants
in
one
island
than
in
another
and
it
would
be
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
somewhat
different
enemies
then
it
varied
natural
selection
would
probably
favour
different
varieties
in
the
different
islands
some
species
however
might
spread
and
yet
retain
the
same
character
throughout
the
group
just
as
we
see
on
continents
some
species
spreading
widely
and
remaining
the
same
the
really
surprising
fact
in
this
case
of
the
galapagos
archipelago
and
in
lesser
degree
in
some
analogous
instances
is
that
the
new
species
formed
in
the
separate
islands
have
not
quickly
sg:‘ead
to
the
other
islands
but
the
islands
though
in
sight
of
each
other
are
separated
by
deep
arms
of
the
sea
in
most
cases
wider
than
the
british
channel
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
have
at
any
former
period
been
continuously
united
the
currents
of
the
sea
are
rapid
and
sweep
across
the
archipelago
and
gales
of
wind
are
extraor
dinarily
rare
so
that
the
islands
are
far
more
effectually
separated
from
each
other
than
they
appear
to
be
on
map
neverthelcss
good
many
species
both
those
found
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
those
contined
to
the
archi
lago
are
common
to
the
several
islands
and
we
may
infer
from
certain
facts
that
these
have
probably
spread
from
some
one
island
to
the
others
but
we
often
take
think
an
erroncous
view
of
the
probabi]ity
of
closely
allied
species
invading
each
other’s
territory

put
into

undoubtedly
if

spe
cies

advantage

both
are
equally
well

in

both
probably
will
hold
their
own

and
keep
sepa
rate
for
almost
any
length
of

being
familiar
with
the
fact
that
many
species
naturalised
through
man’s
agency
have
spread
with
astonishing
rapidity
over

we
are
apt
to
infer
that
most
species
would
thus
spread
but
we
should
remember
that
the
forms
which
become
naturalised
in

are
not
generally

to
the
aboriginal

sir
c
lyell
and
mr
wollaston
have
communicated
to
me
remarkable
fact
bearing
on
this
subject
namely
that
madeira
and
the
adjoining
islet
of
porto
santo
possess
many
distinet
but
representative
land-shells
some
of
which
live
in
crevices
of
stone
;
and
although
large
quantities
of
stone
are
annually
transported
from
porto
santo
to
madeira
yet
this
latter
island
has
not
become
colonised
by
the
porto
santo
species
never
theless
both
islands
have
been
tolonised
by
some
european
land-shells
which
no
doubt
had
some
advantage
over
the
indigenous
species
from
these
considerations
think
we
need
not
greatly
marvel
at
the
endemic
and
representative
species
which
inhabit
the
several
islands
of
the
galapagos
rchipelago
not
having
universally
spread
from
island
to
island
in
many
other
instances
as
in
the
several
districts
of
the
same
continent
ere—occupation
has
probably
played
an
important
part
in
checking
the
commingling
of

caar
xil
oceanic

851
under
the

conditions
of

thus
the
south-east
and
south-west
corners
of
australia
have
nearly
the
same
physical
conditions
and
are
united
by
continuous
land
yet
they
are
inhabited
by
vast
number
of
distinct
mam
mals
birds
and
plants
the
principle
which
determines
the
general
character
of
the
fauna
and
flora
of
oceanic
islands
namely
that
the
inhabitants
when
not
identically
the
same
yet
are
plainly
related
to
the
inhabitants
of
that
region
whence
colonists
could
most
readily
have
been
derived,—the
colonists
hav
ing
been
subsequently
modified
and
better
fitted
to
their
new
homes,—is
of
the
widest
application
throughout
nature
we
see
this
on
every
mountain
in
every
lake
and
marsh
for
alpine
species
excepting
in
so
far
as
the
same
forms
chiefly
of
plants
have
spread
widely
throughout
the
world
during
the
recent
glacial
epoch
are
relate%
to
those
of
the
surrounding
lowlands
thus
we
have
in
south
america
alpine
humming-birds
alpine
rodents
alpine
plants
&c
afl
of
strictly
american
forms
and
it
is
obvious
that
mountain
as
it
became
slowly
u
heaved
would
naturally
be
colonised
from
the
surround
ing
lowlands
so
it
is
with
the
inhabitants
of
lakes
and
marshes
excepting
in
so
far
as
great
facility
of
transport
has
given
the
same
general
forms
to
the
whole
world
we
see
this
same
principle
in
the
blind
animals
inhabit
ing
the
caves
of
erica
and
of
europe
other
analo
gous
facts
could
be
given
and
it
will
believe
be
universally
found
to
be
true
that
wherever
in
two
re
gions
let
them
be
ever
so
distant
many
closely
allied
or
representative
species
occur
there
will
likewise
be
found
some
identical
species
showing
in
accordance
with
the
foregoing
view
that
at
some
former
period
there
has
been
intercommunication
or
migration
between
the
two
regions
and
wherever
many
closely-allied
species
occur
there
will
be
found
many
forms
which
some
naturalists
rank
as
distinct
species
and
some
as
varieties
these
doubtful
forms
showing
us
the
steps
in
the
process
of
modification
this
relation
between
the
power
and
extent
of
migra
tion
of
species
either
at
the
present
time
or
at
some
former
period
under
different
physical
conditions
and
the
853
geographical
distribution
crar
xtl
existence
at
remote
points
of
the
world
of
other
species
allied
to
it
is
shown
in
another
and
more
general
way
mr
gould
remarked
to
me
long
ago
that
in
those
genera
of
birds
which
range
over
the
world
many
of
the
species
have
very
wide
ranges
can
hardly
doubt
that
this
rule
is
generally
true
though
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
it
amongst
mammals
we
see
it
strikingly
displayed
in
bats
and
in
lesser
degree
in
the
felide
and
canidee
we
see
it
if
we
compare
the
distribution
of
butterflies
and
beetles
so
it
is
with
most
fresh-water
productions
in
which
so
many
genera
range
over
the
world
and
many
individual
species
have
enormous
ranges
it
is
not
meant
that
in
world-ranging
genera
all
the
species
have
wide
range
or
even
that
they
have
on
an
average
wide
range
but
only
that
some
of
the
species
range
very
widely
for
the
facility
with
which
widely-ranging
species
vary
and
give
rise
to
new
forms
will
largely
determine
their
aver
range
for
instance
two
varicties
of
the
same
species
inhabit
america
and
europe
and
the
species
thus
has
an
immense
range
but
if
the
variation
had
been
little
greater
the
two
varieties
would
have
been
ranked
as
dis
tinct
species
and
the
common
range
would
have
been
greatly
reduced
still
less
is
it
meant
that
species
which
apparently
has
the
capacity
of
crossing
barriers
and
ranging
widely
as
in
the
case
of
certain
powerfully
winged
birds
will
necessarily
range
widely
for
we
should
never
forget
that
to
range
widely
implies
not
only
the
power
of
crossing
barriers
but
the
more
important
power
of
being
victorious
in
distant
lands
in
the
struggle
for
life
with
foreign
associates
but
on
the
view
of
all
the
spe
cies
of
genus
having
descended
from
single
parent
though
now
distributed
to
the
most
remote
points
of
the
worlg
we
ought
to
find
and
believe
as
general
rule
we
do
find
that
some
at
least
of
the
species
range
very
widely
for
it
is
necessary
that
the
unmodified
parent
should
range
widely
undergoing
modification
during
its
diffusion
and
should
place

we
should
bear
in
mind
that
some
are
extremely
ancient
and
must
have
branched
off
from
common
parent
at
remote
epoch
so
that
in
such
cases
there
will
have
been
am(f]e
time
for
great
climatal
and
geographical
changes
and
for
accidents
of
transport
and
consequently
for
the
migration
of
some
of
the
species
into
all
quarters
of
the
world
where
they
may
have
become
slightly
moditied
in
relation
to
their
new
conditions
there
is
also
some
reason
to
believe
from
geological
evidence
that
organisms
low
in
the
scale
within
each
ereat
class
generally
change
at
slower
rate
than
the
higher
forms
and
consequently
the
lower
forms
will
have
had
better
chance
of
ranging
»vide]ty
and
of
still
retaining
the
same
specific
character
this
fact
together
with
the
seeds
and
eggs
of
many
low
forms
being
very
minute
and
better
ei%tted
for
distant
transportation
probably
accounts
for
law
which
has
long
been
observed
and
which
has
lately
been
admirably
discussed
by
alph
de
candolle
in
regard
to
plants
namely
that
the
lower
any
group
of
organisms
is
the
more
widely
it
is
apt
to
range
the
relations
just
discussed,—namely
low
and
slowli
changing
organisms
ranging
more
widely
than
the
high
some
of
the
species
of
widely-ranging
genera
them
selves
ranging
widely,—such
facts
as
alpine
lacustrine
and
marsh
productions
being
related
with
the
exceptions
before
specified
to
those
on
the
surrounding
low
lands
and
dry
lands
though
these
stations
are
so
different—the
very
close
relation
of
the
distinct
species
which
inhabit
the
islets
of
the
same
archipelago,—and
especially
the
striking
relation
of
the
inhabitants
of
each
whole
archi
pelago
or
island
to
those
of
the
nearest
mainland,—are
thi:ﬁ
utterly
inexplicable
on
the
ordinary
view
of
the
in
dependent
creation
of
each
species
but
are
explicable
on
the
view
of
colonisation
from
the
nearest
and
readiest
source
together
with
the
subsequent
modification
and
better
adaptation
of
the

to
their

and
of

similar

which
may
have
occurred
within

if
we
remember
how
grofoundly
igno

we
are
with

to
the
many

curious

subject
which
has
hardly
ever
been
properly
experimentised
on
if
we
bear
in

how
often
species
may
have
ranged
continuously
over
wide
area
and
then
have
become
extinct
in
the
intermediate

the
difficulties
in
believing
that
all
the
in
dividuals
of
the

wherever
located
have
de

from
the

parents
are
not
insuperable
and
wo
are
led
to
this
conclusion
which
has
been
arrived
at
by
many
naturalists
under
the
designation
of
single
cen
tres
of
creation
by
some
general
considerations
more
especially
from
the
importance
of

and
from
the
analvttgical
distribution
of
sub-genera

and

ith
respect
to
the
distinct
species
of
the
same
genus
which
on
my
theory
must
have
spread
from
one
parent
source
if
we
make
the
same
allowances
as
before
for
our
ignorance
and
remember
that
some

of

change
most
slowly
enormous

thus
granted

do
not
think
that
the

are
insuperable
though
they
often
are
in
this
case
and
in
that
of
the
individuals
of
the

species
extremely
grave
as
exemplifying
the
effects
of
climatal
changes
on
distribution
have
attempted
to
show
how
important
has
been
the
influence
of
the
modern
glacial
period
which
am
fully
convinced
simultaneously
affected
the
whole
world
or
at
least
great
meridional
belts
as
showing
how
diversified
are
the
means
of
occasional
transport
have
discussed
at
some
little
length
the
means
of
dispersal
of
fresh-water
productions
if
the
difficulties
be
not
insuperable
in
admitting
that
in
the
long
course
of
time
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
and
likewise
of
allied
species
have
proceeded
from
some
one
source
then
think
all
the
grand
leading
facts
of
geographical
distribution
are
explicable
on
the
theory
of

the

we
can
thus
under
stand
the
ifh
importance
of
barriers
whether
of

or
water
which
separate
our
several
zoological
and
botan

we
can
thus
understand
the
localisation
of
sub-genera

and
how
it

that
under

for

in

the
inhabitants
of
the

of
the

are
in

mysterious
manner

together
by

are
likewise
linked
to
the

which
formerly
inhabited

bearing
in

that
the
mutual
relations
of

are
of
the
highest
importance
we
can
see
why
two
areas
having
nearly

conditions
should
often
be
inhabited
by
very
different
forms
of

for
according
to
the
length
of

which
has
elapsed
since
new

allowed
certain

those
which

ha

to
come
in

wi

and
with
the
aborigines
and
according
as
the

were
capable

there
would
ensue

why

should
have

in

and
the

between
an

and

we
can
clearly
see
why
all
the
inhabitants
of

should
be
closely

of

derived
we
can
see
why
in

areas
however

from
each

there
should
be
correlation
in
the
presence
of
identical
species
of
varie
ties
of

and
of

representative
ecies
as
the
late
edward
forbes
often
insisted
there
is
striking
parallelism
in
the
laws
of
life
throughout

and

the
laws
governing
the
succession
of
forms
in

being
nearly

our
not

in

the
forms
which
are
therein
absent
but
which
occur
above

8o
in

it
certainly
is
the
general
rule
that
the
area
inhabited
by
single
spe
cies
or
by
group
of
species
is
continuous
and
the
ex
ceptions
which
are
not
rare
may
as
have
attempted
to
show
be
accounted
for
by
migration
at
some
former
period
under
different
conditions
or
by
occasional
means
of
transport
and
by
the
species
having
become

in
looking
to
the
long
succession
of

as
in
now
looking
to
distant

throughout
the

we
find
that
some

generally
change
less
than
the
higher
but
there
are
in
both
cases
marked
exceptions
to
the
rule
on
my
theory
these
several
relations
throughout
time
and
space
are
intelligible
for
whether
we
look
to
the
forms
of
life
which
have
changed
during

within

of

or
to
those
which
have
changed
after
having
migrated
into

in
both
cases
the

being
in
the
economy
of
nature
would
be
of
very
high
importance
in
classification
nothing
can
be
more
false
no
one
regards
the
external
similarity
of

to

of

of

as

ese

to

classification
861
the
consideration
of
tliese
reseniblances
we
shall
have
to
recur
it
may
even
be
given
as
general
rule
that
the
less
any
part
of
the
organisation
is
concerned
with
special
habits
the
more
important
it
becomes
for
classification
as
an
instance
owen
in
speaking
of
the
dugong
says
the
generative
organs
being
those
which
are
most
re
motely
related
to
the
habits
and
food
of
an
animal
have
always
regarded
as
affording
ver{
clear
indications
of
its
true
affinities
we
are
least
likely
in
the
modifications
of
these
organs
to
mistake
merely
adaptive
for
an
essential
character
so
with
plants
how
remarkable
it
is
that
the
organs
of
vegetation
on
which
their
whole
life
de
ends
are
of
little
signification
excepting
in
the
first
main
ivisions
whereas
the
organs
of
reproduction
with
their
product
the
seed
are
of
paramount
importance
we
must
not
therefore
in
classifying
trust
to
resem
blances
in
parts
of
the
organisation
however
important
they
may
be
for
the
welfare
of
the
being
inrelation
to
the
outer
world
perhaps
from
this
cause
it
has
partly
arisen
that
almost
all
naturalists
lay
the
greatest
stress
on
rescm
blances
in
organs
of
high
vital
or
physiological
impor
tance
no
doubt
this
view
of
the
classificatory
importance
of
organs
which
are
important
is
generally
but
by
no
means
always
true
but
their
importance
for
classifica
tion
believe
depends
on
their
greater
constancy
through
out
large
groups
of
species
and
this
constancy
depends
on
such
organs
having
generally
been
subjected
to
less
change'in
the
adaptation
of
the
species
to
their
conditions
of
life
that
the
mere
physiological
importance
of
an
organ
does
not
determine
its
classificatory
value
is
almost
shown
by
the
one
fact
that
in
allied
groups
in
which
the
same
organ
as
we
have
every
reason
to
suppose
has
nearly
the
same
physiological
value
its
classificatory
value
is
widely
different
no
naturalist
can
have
worked
at
any
group
without
being
struck
with
this
fact
and
it
has
been
most
fully
acknowledged
in
the
writings
of
almost
every
author
it
will
suffice
to
gﬁyte
the
highest
authori
ty
robert
brown
who
in
speaki
of
certain
organs
in
ke
proteaces
says
their
generic
importance
like
that
of
all
their
parts
not
only
in
this
but
as
apprehend
in

olassification
{omar
xiil
every
natural
family
is
very
unequal
and
in
some
cases
seems
to
be
entirely
lost
again
in
another
work
he
says
the
genera
of
the
connaraces
differ
in
having
one
or
more
ovaria
in
the
existence
or
absence
of
albumen
in
the
imbricate
or
valvular
@stivation
any
one
of
these
characters
aing]i
is
frequently
of
more
than
generic
im
portance
though
here
even
when
all
taken
together
they
appear
insufficient
to
separate
cnestis
from
connarus
j.l
ive
an
example
amongst
insects
in
one
great
division
of
the
hymenoptera
the
antennse
as
westwood
has
re
marked
are
most
constant
in
structure
in
another
divi
sion
they
differ
much
and
the
differences
are
of
quite
subordinate
value
in
classification
yet
no
one
probably
will
say
that
the
antenns
in
these
two
divisions
of
the
same
order
are
of
unequal
gh{
iological
importance
any
number
of
instances
could
be
given
of
the
varying
im
portance
for
classification
of
the
same
important
organ
within
the
same
group
of
beings
again
no
one
will
say
that
rudimenta.riy
or
atrophied
organs
are
of
high
physiological
or
vital
importance
et
undoubtedly
organs
in
this
condition
are
often
of
ki
value
in
classification
no
one
will
dispute
that
the
rudimentary
teeth
in
the
upper
jaws
of
young
ruminants
and
certain
rudimentary
bones
of
the
leg
are
highly
ser
viceable
in
exhibiting
the
close
affinity
between
igumi
nants
and
pachyderms
robert
brown
has
strongly
in
sisted
on
the
fact
that
the
rudimentary
florets
are
of
the
highest
importance
in
the
classification
of
the
grasses
numerous
instances
could
be
given
of
characters
de
rived
from
parts
which
must
be
considered
of
very
triflin
physiological
importance
but
which
are
universally
a.(ﬁ
mitted
as
highly
serviceable
in
the
definition
of
whole
groups
for
instance
whether
or
not
there
is
an
open
passaﬁ;from
the
nostrils
to
the
mouth
the
only
character
according
to
owen
which
absolutely
distinguishes
fishes
and
reptiles—the
inflection
of
the
angle
of
the
jaws
in
marsupials—the
manner
in
which
the
wings
of
insects
are
folded—mere
colour
in
certain
algee—mere
pubescence
on
the
parts
of
the
flower
in
grasses—the
nature
of
the
dermal
covering
as
hair
or
feathers
in
the
vertebrata
omar
xiil
classification
363
if
the
ornithorhynchus
had
been
covered
with
feathers
instead
of
hair
this
external
and
trifling
character
would
think
have
been
considered
by
naturalists
as
important
an
aid
in
determining
the
degree
of
affinity
of
this
strange
creature
to
birds
and
reptiles
as
an
approach
in
structure
in
any
one
internal
and
important
organ
the
importance
for
classification
of
trifling
characters
mainly
depends
on
their
being
correlated
with
several
other
characters
of
more
or
less
importance
the
value
indeed
of
an
aggr;fute
of
characters
is
very
evident
in
natural
history
hence
as
has
often
been
remarked
species
may
depart
from
its
allies
in
several
characters
both
of
high
physiological
importance
and
of
almost
uni
versal
prevalence
and
yet
leave
us
in
no
doubt
where
it
should
be
ranked
hence
also
it
has
been
found
that
classification
founded
on
any
single
character
however
important
that
may
be
has
always
failed
for
no
part
of
the
organisation
is
universally
constant
the
importance
of
an
aggregate
of
characters
even
when
none
are
im
portant
alone
explains
think
that
saying
of
linnseus
that
the
characters
do
not
give
the
genus
but
the
genus
gives
the
characters
for
this
saying
seems
founded
on
an
a{preciation
of
many
trifling
points
of
resemblance
too
slight
to
be
defined
certain
plants
belonging
to
the
malpighiacese
bear
perfect
and
%e
aded
flowers
in
the
latter
as
a
de
jussieu
has
remarked
the
greater
number
of
the
characters
proper
to
the
species
to
the
genus
to
the
family
to
the
class
disappear
and
thus
langh
at
our
classification
but
when
aspicarpa
produced
in
france
during
several
years
only
degraded
ﬁ}(;wers
departing
so
wonderfully
in
number
of
the
most
important
points
of
structure
from
the
proper
type
of
the
order
yet
m
richard
sagaciously
saw
as
jussien
observes
that
this
genus
should
still
be
retained
amongst
the
malpighiacese
this
case
seems
to
me
well
to
illustrate
the
spirit
with
which
our
classifications
are
sometimes
necessarily
founded
practically
when
naturalists
are
at
work
they
do
not
trouble
themselves
about
the
physiological
value
of
the
characters
which
they
use
in

in

they
use

as
one
of
high
value
if
common
to
some
lesser
number
they
use
it
as

this
principle
has
been
broadly
con
fessed
by
some
naturalists
to
be
the
true
one
and
by
none
more
clearly
than
by
that
excellent
botanist
aug
st
hilaire
if
certain
characters
are
always
found
cor
related
with
others
though
no
apparent
bond
of
connexion
ean
be
discovered
between
them
especial
value
is
set
on
them
as
in
most
groups
of
animals
important
organs
such
as
those
for
propelling
the
blood
or
for
aérating
it
or
those
for
propagating
the
race
are
found
nearly
uni
form
they
are
consiﬁzredg
as
highly
serviceable
in
classifica
tion
but
in
some
groups
of
animals
all
these
the
most
im
portant
vital
organs
are
found
to
offer
characters
of
quite
subordinate
value
we
can
see
why
characters
derived
from
the
embryo
should
be
of
eqna{
importance
with
those
derived
from
the
adult
for
our
classifications
of
course
include
all
ages
of
each
species
but
it
is
by
no
means
obvious
on
the
ordinary
view
why
the
structure
of
the
embryo
should
be
more
important
for
this
purpose
than
that
of
the
adult
which
alone
plays
its
full
part
in
the
economy
of
nature
yet
it
has
been
strongly
urged
by
those
great
naturalists
milne
edwards
and
agassiz
that
embryonic
characters
are
the
most
important
of
any
in
the
classification
of
ani
mals
and
this
doctrine
has
very
generally
been
admitted
as
true
the
same
fact
holds
good
with
&)wering
lants
of
which
the
two
main
divisions
have
been
founded
on
characters
derived
from
the
embryo,—on
the
number
and
position
of
the
embryonic
leaves
or
cotyledons
and
on
the
mode
of
development
of
the
plumule
and
radicle
in
our
discussion
on
embryology
we
shall
see
why
such
characters
are
so
valuable
on
the
view
of
classitication
tacitly
including
the
idea
of
descent
our
classifications
are
often
plainly
influenced
by
chains
of
affinities
nothing
can
be
easier
than
to
define
nunber
of
characters
common
to
all
birds
but
in
the
case
of
crustaccans
such
definition
has
hitherto
been
found
impossible

all
the

difficulties
in

are
explained
if
do
not
greatly
deceive
myself
on
the
view
that
the
natural
system
is
founded
on
descent
with
modification
that
the
characters
which
naturalists
consider
as
showing
true
aﬂinit{
between
any
two
or
more
species
are
those
which
have
been
inherited
from
common
parent
and
in
so
far
all
true
classifica
tion
is
ealogical
that
community
of
descent
is
the
hidden
bond
which
naturalists
have
{)een
unconsciously
seeking
and
not
some
unknown
plan
of
creation
or
the
enunciation
of
general
propositions
and
the
mere
putting
together
and
separating

more
or
less
alike
but
must
explain
my
mesning
more
fully
be
lieve
that
the
arrangement
of
the
groups
within
each
class
in

subordination
and

to
the
other

must
be
strictly
genealogical

due

their

all

along

the

this

only

on

the

to
be

but
the
proper
or
even
only

arrangement
would
still
be
genealogical

this
would
be
strictly
natural
as
it
would
connect
together
all

would

the

of

in
confirmation
of
this
view
let
us
glance
at
the
classification
of
varieties
which
are
believed
or
known
to
have
descended
from
one
species
these
are
grouped
under
species
with
sub-varieties
under
varieties
and
with
our
domestic
productions
several
other
grades
of
difference
are
requisite
as
we
have
seen
with
pigeons
the
origin
of
the
existence
of
groups
subordinate
to
groups
is
the
same
with
varieties
as
with
species
namely
closeness
of
descent
with
various
degrees
of
modification
nearly
the
same
rules
are
followed
in
classifying
varicties
as
with
species
authors
have
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
classing
varieties
on
natural
instead
of
an
artificial
system
we
are
cautioned
for
instance
not
to
class
two
varieties
of
the
pine-apple
together
merely
because
their
fruit
though
the
most
important
part
happens
to
be
nearly
identical
no
one
puts
the
swedish
and
common
turnips
together
though
the
esculent
and
thickened
stems
are
so
similar
whatever
part
is
found
to
be
most
con
stant
is
used
in
classing
varieties
thus
the
great
agri
culturist
marshall
says
the
horns
are
very
useful
for
this
purpose
with
cattle
because
they
are
less
variable
than
the
shape
or
colour
of
the
body
&c
whereas
with
sheep
the
horns
are
much
less
serviceable
because
less

it

we

whether
there

it

the
whole

is
preposterous
for
where
there
has

in

there
will
certainly
be
close

not
this

has

it

we
have
no

we
choose

we

account
for

may
err
in

when

occur

we

may
sometimes
be
rought

very
impor

lamarck
first
called
attention
to
this
distinction
and
he
has
been
ably
followed
by
macleay
and
others
the
resemblance
in
the
shape
of
the
body
and
in
the
fin-like
anterior
limbs
between
the
dugong
which
is
pachydermatous
animal
and
the
whale
and
between
b0£1
these
mammals
and
fishes
is
analogical
amongst
insects
there
are
innumerable
instances
thus
linneeus
misled
by
external
appearances
actually
classed
an
homopterous
insect
as
moth
we
see
something
of
the
same
kind
even
in
our
domestic
varieties
as
in
the
thickened
stems
of
the
common
and
swedish
turnip
the
resemblance
of
the
greyhound
and
racehorse
48
hardly
more
fanciful
than
the
analogies
which
have
been
drawn
by
some
authors
between
very
distinct
ani
mals
on
my
view
of

being
of
real

for

only

as

classification
omar
xtil

we
can
clearly
understand
why
analogical
or
adaptive
character
although
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
welfare
of
the
being
are
almost
valueless
to
the
sys
tematist
for
animals
belonging
to
two
most
distinct
lines
of
descent
may
readily
become
adapted
to
similar
conditions
and
thus
assume
close
external
resemblance
but
such
resemblances
will
not
reveal—will
rather
tend
to
conceal
their
blood-relationship
to
their
proper
lines
of
descent
we
can
also
understand
the
fpa.rent
aradox
that
the
very
same
characters
are
analogical
when
one
class
or
order
is
compared
with
another
but
give
true
affinities
when
the
members
of
the
same
class
or
order
are
compared
one
with
another
thus'the
shape
of
the
body
and
fin-like
limbs
are
only
analogical
when
whales
are
compared
with
fishes
being
adaptations-in
both
classes
for
swimming
through
the
water
but
the
shape
of
the
body
and
fin-like
limbs
serve
as
characters
exhibiting
true
affinity
between
the
several
members
of
the
whale
family
for
these
cetaceans
agree
in
so
many
characters
great
and
small
that
we
cannot
doubt
that
they
have
inherited
their
general
shape
of
body
and
structure
of
limbs
from
com
mon
ancestor
so
it
is
with
fishes
as
members
of
distinct
classes
have
often
been
adapt
ed
by
successive
slight
modifications
to
live
under
nearly
similar
circumstances,—to
inhabit
for
instance
the
three
elements
of
land
air
and
water,—we
can
perhaps
under
stand
how
it
is
that
numerical
parallelism
has
some
times
been
observed
between
the
sub-groups
in
distinet
classes
naturalist
struck
by
parallelism
of
this
nature
in
any
one
class
by
arbitrarily
raising
or
sinking
the
value
of
the
groups
in
other
classes
ann(f
all
our
ex
perience
shows
that
this
valuation
has
hitherto
been
arbi
trary
could
easig
extend
the
parallelism
over
wide
range
and-thus
the
septenary
quinary
quaternary
and
ternary
classifications
have
probably
arisen
as
the
modified
descendants
of
dominant
species
be
longing
to
the
larger
genera
tend
to
inherit
the
advan
tages
which
made
the
groups
to
which
they
belong
large
and
their
parents
dominant
they
are
ost
sure
to
spread
widely
and
to
seize
on
more
and
more
places

xiil
classification
313
the
economy
of
nature
the
larger
and
more
dominant
groups
thus
tend
to
go
on
increasing
in
size
and
they
consequently
supplant
many
smaller
and
feebler
groups
thus
we
can
account
for
the
fact
that
all
organisnis
recent
and
extinct
are
included
under
few
great
orders
under
still
fewer
classes
and
all
in
one
great
natural
sys
tem
as
showing
how
few
the
higher
groups
are
in
number
and
how
widely
spread
they
are
throughout
the
world
the
fact
is
striking
that
the
discovery
of
australia
has
not
added
single
insect
belonging
to
new
order
and
that
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
as
learn
from
dr
hooker
it
has
added
only
two
or
three
orders
of
small
size
in
the
chapter
on
geological
succession
attempted
to
show
on
the
}]:rinciple
of
each
group
having
generally
diverged
much
in
character
during
the
long-continued
¥rocess
of
modification
how
it
is
that
the
more
ancient
orms
of
life
often
present
characters
in
some
slight
degree
intermediate
between
existing
groups
few
old
and
intermediate
parent-forms
having
occasionally
trans
mitted
to
the
present
day
descendants
but
little
modified
will
give
to
us
our
so-called
osculant
or
aberrant
groups
the
more
aberrant
any
form
is
the
greater
must
be
number
of
connecting
forms
which
on
my
theory
have
been
exterminated
and
utterly
lost
and
we
have
some
evidence
of
aberrant
forms
having
suffered
severely
from
extinction
for
they
are
generally
represented
by
extreme
ly
few-species
and
such
species
as
5)0
occur
are
generally
very
distinct
from
each
other
which
again
implies
extinc
tion
the
genera
ornithorhynchus
and
lepidosiren
for
example
would
not
have
been
less
aberrant
had
each
been
represented
by
dozen
species
instead
of
by
single
one
but
such
richness
in
species
as
find
after
some
in
vestigation
does
not
commonly
fall
to
the
lot
of
aberrant
enera
we
can
think
account
for
this
fact
only
by
ooking
at
aberrant
forms
as
failing
groups
conquered
by
more
successful
competitors
with
few
members
pre
served
by
some
unusual
coincidence
of
favourable
circum
stances
mr
waterhouse
hag
remarked
that

member
374
olassification
{crar

belonging
to
one
group
of
animals
exhibits
an
affinity
to
qluite
distinet
group
this
affinity
in
most
cases
is
gen
eral
and
not
special
thus
according
to
mr
waterhouse
of
all
rodents
the
bizcacha
is
most
nearly
related
to
mar
supials
but
in
the
points
in
which
it
approaches
this
order
its
relations
are
general
and
not
to
any
one
mar
supial
species
more
than
to
another
as
the
points
of
nity
of
the
bizcacha
to
marsupials
are
believed
to
be
real
and
not
merely
adaptive
they
arc
due
on
my
theory
to
inheritance
in
common
therefore
we
must
suppose
either
that
all
rodents
including
the
bizeacha
branched
off
from
some
very
ancient
marsupial
which
will
have
had
character
in
some
degree
intermediate
with
respect
to
all
existing
marsupials
or
that
both
rodents
and
marsupials
branched
off
from
common
progenitor
and
that
both
groups
have
since
undergone
much
modification
in
divergent
directions
on
either
view
we
may
suppose
that
the
bizcacha
has
retained
by
inheritance
more
of
the
character
of
its
ancient
progenitor
than
have
other
rodents
and
therefore
it
will
not
be
specially
related
to
any
one
existing
marsupial
but
indirectly
to
all
or
nearly
all
marsupials
from
having
partially
retained
the
character
of
their
common
pro%fmtor
or
of
an
early
member
of
the
group
on
the
other
hand
of
all
marsu
pials
as
mr
waterhouse
has
remarked
the
phascolomys
reseinbles
most
nearly
not
any

but
the

ral
order
of
rodents
in
this
case
however
it
may
be
strongly
suspected
that
the
resemblance
is
only
analogi
cal
owing
to
the
phascolomys
having
become
adapted
to
habits
like
those
of
rodent
the
elder
de
candolle
has
made
nearly
similar
osbservations
on
the
general
nature
of
the
affinities
of
distinct

of
plants
on
the
principle
of
the
multiplication
and
gradual
di

in
character
of
the
species
descended
from
com

together
with
their
retention
by
inheritance
of
some
characters
in

we
can
understand
the
excessively
complex
and
radiating
affinities
by
which
all
the

of

con

even
by

almost
impossible
to

we
can
understand
the
extraor
dinary
difficulty
which
naturalists
have
experienced
in
describing
without
the
aid
of

the
various
aftinities
which
they
perceive
between
the
many
living

extinetion

we

in

fourth
chapter
has
played
an
important
part
in
defining
and
widening
the
intervals
between
the
several
groups
in
each
class
we
may
thus
account
even
for
the
distinctness
of
whole
classes
from
each
other—for
instance
of
birds
from
all
other
ver
tebrate
animals—by
the
belief
that
many
ancient
forms
of
life
have
been
utterly
lost
through
which
the
early
progenitors
of
birds
were
formerly
connected
with
the
early
progenitors
of
the
other
vertebrate
classes
there
has
been
less
entire
extinction
of
the
forms
of
life
which
once
connected
fishes
with
batrachians
there
has
been
still
less
in
some
other
clagses
as
in
that
of
the
crustacea
for
here
the
most
wonderfully
diverse
forms
are
still
tied
together
by
long
but
broken
chain
of
affinities
ex
tinction
has
only
separated
groups
it
has
by
no
means
made
them
for
if
every
form
which
has
ever
lived
on
this
earth
were
suddenly
to
reappear
though
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
give
definitions
by
which
each
grong
could
be
distinguished
from
other
groups
as
all
woul
blend
together
by
steps
as
fine
as
those
between
the
finest
existing
varieties
nevertheless
natural
classification
or
at
least
natural
arrangement
would
be
possible
we
shall
see
this
by
turning
to
the
diagram
the

eleven
silurian

of

their
primordial
parent
and
every
intermediate
link
in
each
branch
and
sub-branch
of
their
descendants
may
be
supposed
to
be
still
alive
and
the
links
to
be
as
fine
as
those
between
the
finest
varieties
in
this
case
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
give
any
definition
by
which
the
several
members
of
the
several
groups
could
be
distin
guished
from
their
more
immediate
parents
or
these
parents
from
their
ancient
and
unknown
progenitor
yet
the
natural
arrangement
in
the
diagram
would
still
hold
ﬁood
and
on
the
principle
of
inheritance
all
the
forms
escended
from
a
or
from
i
would
have
something
in
common
in
tree
we
can
specify
this
or
that
branch
though
atthe
actual
fork
the
two
unite
and
blend
together
we
could
not
as
have
said
define
the
several
groups
but
we
could
pick
out
types
or
forms
representing
most
of
the
characters
of
each
group
whether
large
or
small
and
thus
iive
general
idea
of
the
value
of
the
differences
between
them
this
is
what
we
should
be
driven
to
if
we
were
ever
to
succeed
in
collecting
all
the
forms
in
any
class
which
have
lived
throughout
all
time
and
space
we
shall
certainly
never
succeed
in
making
so
perfect
collection
nevertheless
in
certain
classes
we
are
tendin
in
this
direction
and
milne

has
lately
insisted
in
an
able
paper
on
the
high
importance
of
looking
to
types
whether
or
not
we
can
separate
and
define
the
groups
to
which
such
types
belong
inally
we
have
seen
that
natural
selection
which
results
from
the
struggle
for
existence
and
which
almost
inevitably
induces
extinction
and
divergence
of
character
in
the
many
descendants

they

believe
this

the

than

why
we

in

we
have

expressed
by

the

be
said
to
be
its

that

that

we
can
at
once
perceive
the

signification
of
the
homologous
construction
of
the

throughout

whole
class
so
with
the
mouths
of
insects
we
have
only
to
suppose
that
their
common
progenitor
had
an
upper
lip
mandibles
and
two
pair
of
maxille
these
parts
being
perhaps
very
simple
in
form
and
then
natural
selec
tion
will
account
for
the
infinite
diversity
in
structure
and
function
of
the
mouths
of
insects
nevertheless
it
is
couceivable
that
the
general
pattern
of
an
organ
might
become
so
much
obscured
as
to
be
finally
lost
by
the
atroph{
and
ultimately
by
the
complete
abortion
of
certain
arts
by
the
soldering
together
of
other
parts
and
by
the
goubling
or
multiplication
of
others,—variations
which
we
know
to
be
within
the
limits
of
possibility
in
the
paddles
of
the
extinct
gigantic
sea-lizards
and
in
the
mouths
of
certain
snctoritﬁ
crustaceans
the
general
pattern
seems
to
have
been
thus
to
certain
extent
obscured
there
is
another
and
equally
curious
branch
of
the
present
subject
namely
the
comparison
not
of
the
same
part
in
different
members
of
class
but
of
the
different
parts
or
organs
in
the
same
individual
most
hysiologists
believe
that
the
bonmes
of
the
skull
are
ﬁomologous
with—that
is
correspond
in
number
and
in
relative

the
relative
position
of

well
as
their
intimate

intelligible
on
the
view
that
theﬁconsist
of
metamorphosed

monstrous
plants
we
often
get
direct
evi

of
the
possibility
of
one
organ
being
transformed
into
another
and
we
can
actually
see
in
embryonic
crustaceans
and
in
many
other
animals
and
in

that
organs
which
when
mature
become

be
all
constructed
on

the
theory

we
can
satisfactorily
answer
these
questions
in
the
vertebrata
we
see
series
of
internal
vertebrse
bearing
certain
processes
and
appen
dages
in
the
articulata
we
see
the
body
divided
into
series
of
seg]ments
bearing
external
appendages

in

we
see
series
of
successive
spiral
whorls
of

an
indefinite
repetition
of
the

part
or
organ
is
the
common
characteristic
as
owen
has
observed
of
all
low

therefore
we
may
readily
believe
that
the
unkncwn

formerly.seen
that

repeated
are
eminently
liable
to
vary
in
number
and
structure
consequently
it
is
quite
probable
that
natural
selection

should
have
seized
on

however
use

head
and
trunk
in
these
animals
the
extremities
however
are
still
absent
in
these
embryos
but
even
if
they
existed
in
the
earliest
stage
of
their
development
we
should
learn
nothing
for
the
feet
of
lizards
and
mamnals
the
wings
and
feet
of
birds
no
less
than
the
hands
and
feet
of
man
all
arise
from
the
same
fundamental
form
the
vermiform
larve
of
moths
flies
beetles
&c
resemble
each
other
much
more
closely
than
do
the
mature
insects
but
in
the
case
of
larvee
the
embryos
are
active
and
have
been
adapted
for
special
lines
of
life
trace
of
the
law
of
embryonic
resemblance
sometimes
lasts
till
rather
late
age
thus
birds
of
the
same
genus
and
of
closely
allied
genera
often
resemble
each
other
in
their
first
and
second
plumage
as
we
see
in
the
spotted
feathers
in
the
thrush
group
in
the
ecat
tribe
most
of
the
species
are
striped
or
spotted
in
lines
and
stripes
can
be
plainly
distinguished
in
the
whelp
of
the
lion
we
occasionally
though
rarely
see
something
of
this
kind
in
plants
thus
the
embryonic
leaves
of
the
ulex
or
furze
and
the
first
leaves
of
the
rdphyl]odineons
acacias
are
pinnate
or
divided
like
the
ordinary
leaves
of
the
legumi

the
points
of
structure
in
which
the
embryos
of
wide
ly
different
animals
of
the
same
class
resemble
each
other
often
have
né
direct
relation
to
their
conditions
of
existence
we
cannot
for
instance
suppose
that
in
the
embryos
of
the
vertebrata
the
peculiar
loop-like
course
of
the
arteries
near
the
branchial
slits
are
related
to
similar
conditions,—in
the
young
mammal
which
is
nourished
in
the
womb
of
its
mother
in
the
egg
of
the
bird
which
is
hatched
in

and
in
the
spawn
of

wo
hiave
no
more
reason
to
believe
in
sauch
relation
than
we
have
to
believe
that
the
same
bones
in
the
hand
of
man
wing
of
bat
and
fin
of
porpoise
are
related
to
similar
conditions
of
life
no
one
will
suppose
that
the
stripes
on
the
whelp
of
lion
or
the
spots
on
the
young
blackbird
are
of
any
use
to
these
animals
or
are
related
to
the
conditions
to
which
they
are
exposed
the
case
however
is
different
when
an
animal
during
any
part
of
its
embryonic
career
is
active
and
has
to
provide
for
itself
the
%eriod
of
activity
may
come
on
earlier
or
later
in
life
but
whenever
it
comes
on
the
adaptation
of
the
larva
to
its
conditions
of
life
is
just
as
perfect
and
as
beautiful
as
in
the
adult
animal
from
such
special
adaptations
the
similarity
of
the
larvee
or
active
embryos
of
allied
animals
is
sometimes
much
obscur
ed
and
cases
could
be
given
of
the
larvee
of
two
species
or
of
two
groups
of
species
differing
quite
as
much
or
even
more
from
each
other
than
do
their
adult
parents
inmost
cases
however
the
larvee
though
active
still
obey
more
or
less
closely
thelaw
of
common
embryonic
resemblance
cir
ripedes
afford
good
instance
of
this
even
the
illustrious
cuvier
did
not
perceive
that
barnacle
was
as
it
certainly
is
crustacean
but
glance
at
the
larva
shows
this
to
be
the
case
in
an
unmistakeable
manner
so
again
the
two_main
divisions
of
cirripedes
the
pedunculated
and
sessile
which
differ
widely
in
external
appearance
have
larvee
in
all
their
several
stages
barely
distinguishable
the
embryo
in
the
course
of
development
generally
rises
in
organisation
use
this
expression
though
am
aware
that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
define
clearly
what
is
meant
by
the
organisation
being
higher
or
lower
but
no
one
probably
will
dispute
that
the
butterfly
is
higher
than
the
caterpillar
in
some
cases
however
the
mature
animal
is
generally
considered
as
lower
in
the
scale
than
the
larva
as
with
certain
parasitic
crustaceans
to
refer
once
again
to
cirripedes
the
larveein
the
first
stage
have
three
pairs
of
legs
very
simple
single
eye
and
probos
ciformed
mouth
with
which
they
feed
argely
for
they
increase
much
in
size
in
the
second
stage
answering
to
the
chrysalis
stage
of
butterflies
they
have
six
pairs

cuur

beautifully

legs
lmr
of
magnificent
compound
eyes
and
extremely
complex
antenns
but
they
have
closed
and
imperfect
mouth
and
cannot
feed
their
function
at
this
stage
is
to
search
by
their
well-de
veloped
organs
of
sense
and
to
reach
by
their
active
powers
of
swimming
proper
place
on
which
to
become
attached
and
to
undergo
their
final
metamorphosis
when
this
is
completed
they
are
fixed
for
life
their
legs
are
now
converted
into
prehensile
organs
they
again
obtain
well-constructed

they
have
no

and
their
two

are
now
reconvertf:iy
into

and
complete
state
cirripedes
may
be
considered
as
either
more
highly
or
more
lowly
organised
than
they
were
in
the
larval
condition
but
in
some
genera
the
larve
become
developed
either
into
hermaphrodites
having
the
ordinary
structure
or
into
what
have
called
complemental
males
and
in
the
latter
the
development
has
assuredly
been
retrograde
for
the
male
is
mere
sack
which
lives
for
short
time
and
is
destitute
of
mouth
stomach
or
other
organ
of
importance
excepting
for
reproduction
are
so
much
accustomed
to
see
differences
in
struc
ture
between
the
embryo
and
the
adult
and
likewise
close
similarity
in
the
embryos
of
widely
different
animals
within
the
same
class
that
we
might
be
led
to
look
at
these
facts
as
necessarily
contingent
in
some
manner
on
owth
but
there
is
no
obvious
reason
why
for
instance
the
wing
of
bat
or
the
fin
of
porpoise
should
not
have
been
sketched
out
with
all
the
parts
in
proper
pro
portion
as
soon
as
any
structure
became
visible
in
the
embryo
and
in
some
whole
groups
of
animals
and
in
certain
members
of
other
groups
the
embryo
does
not
at
any
period
differ
widely
from
the
adult
thus
owen
has
remarked

there
is
no

the

character
is
manifested

the

yet
nearly
all
pass
through
similar
worm-like
stage
of

but
in
some
few
cases
as
in
that
ofaﬁ
his
if
we
look
to
the
admirable
drawings
by
profes
sor
huxley
of
the
development
of
this
insect
we
see
no
trace
of
the
vermiform
stage
how
then
can
we
explain
these
several
facts
in
em
bryology,—namely
the
very
general
but
not
universal
ifference
in
structure
between
the
embryo
and
the
adult
of
parts
in
the
same
individual
embryo
which
ulti
mately
become
very
unlike
and
serve
for
diverse
purposes
being
at
this
early
period
of
growth
alike
of
embryos
of
different
species
within
the
same
class
fgenemlly
but
not
universa.d
resembling
each
other
of
the
structure
of
the
embryo
not
being
closely
related
to
its
conditions
of
existence
except
when
the
embryo
becomes
at
any
period
of
life
active
and
has
to
provide
for
itself
of
the
embryo
apﬁnrently
having
sometimes
higher
organisa
tion
tian
the
mature
animal
into
which
it
is
developed
believe
that
all
these
facts
can
be
explained
as
follows
on
the
view
of
descent
with
modification
it
is
commonly
assumed
perhaps
from
monstrosities
often
affecting
the
embryo
at
very
early
period
that
slight
variations
necessarily
appear
at
an
equally
early
period
but
we
have
little
evidence
on
this
head—indeed
the
evidence
rather
points
the
other
way
for
it
is
noto
rious
that
breeders
of
cattle
horses
and
various
fancy
animals
cannot
positively
tell
until
some
time
after
the
animal
has
been
born
what
its
merits
or
form
will
ulti
mately
turn
out
we
see
this
plainly
in
our
own
chil
dren
we
cannot
always
tell
whether
the
child
will
be
tall
or
short
or
what
1ts
precise
features
will
be
the
question
is
not
at
what
period
of
life
any
variation
has
been
caused
but
at
what
period
it
is
fully
displayed
the
canse
may
have
acted
and
believe
generally
has
acted
even
before
the
embryo
is
formed
and
the
variation
may
be
due
to
the
male
and
female
sexual
elements
having
been
affected
by
the
conditions
to
which
either
parent
or
their
ancestors
have
been
exposed
nevertheless
an
effect
thus
caused
at
very
early
period
even
before
the
formation
of
the
embryo
may
appear
late
in
life
as
when
886

omer
xal
an
hereditary
disease
which
appears
in
old
alone
has
been
communicated
to
the
offspring
from
ﬁ
repro
ductive
element
of
one
parent
or
in
a8
when
the
horns
of
cross-bred
cattle
have
been
affected
by
the
shape
of
the
horns
of
either
parent
for
the
welfare
of
very
young
animal
as
long
as
it
remains
in
its
mother’s
womb
or
in
the
egg
or
as
long
as
it
is
nourished
and
protected
by
its
t
it
must
be
quite
unimportant
whether
most
of
its
cl
rs
are
fully
acquired
little
earlier
or
later
in
life
it
would
not
signify
for
instance
to
bird
which
obtained
its
food
best
by
having
long
beak
whether
or
not
it
assumed
beak
of
this
particular
length
as
long
as
it
was
fed
by
its
parents
hence
conclude
that
it
ie
quite
possible
that
each
of
the
many
successive
modifica~
tions
by
which
each
species
has
acquired
its
present
struc
ture
may
have
supervened
at
not
very
early
period
of
life
and
some
direct
evidence
from
our
domestic
animals
supports
this
view
but
in
other
cases
it
is
quite
possible
that
each
successive
modification
or
most
of
them
may
have
appeared
at
an
extremely
earlycgeﬂ
have
stated
in
the
first
chapter
that
there
is
some
520
evidence
to
render
it
probable
that
at
whatever
age
any
variation
first
appears
in
the
témrent
it
tends
to
reappear
at
corresponding
age
in
the
offspring
certain
varia
tions
can
only
appear
at
correspomﬁng
ages
for
instance
peculiarities
in
the
caterpillar
cocoon
or
imago
states
of
the
silk-moth
or
again
in
the
horns
of
almost
full-grown
cattle
but
further
than
this
variations
which
for
all
that
we
can
see
might
have
appeared
earlier
or
later
in
life
tend
to
appear
at
corresponding
aee
in
the
offspring
and
parent
am
far
from
meaning
that
this
is
invari
ably
the
case
and
could
give
good
many
cases
of
va
riations
taking
the
word
in
the
largest
sense
which
have
supervened
at
an
earlier
age
in

child
than
in

these
two
principles
if
their
truth
be
admitted
will
believe
explain
all
the
above
specified
leading
facts
in
embryology
but
first
let
us
look
at
few
analogous
cases
in
%mestic
varieties
some
authors
who
have
written
on

that

rdnoiit

have
probably
descended
from
the
same
wild
stock
hence
was
curious
to
see
how
far
their
pu};gies
differed
from
each
other
was
told
by
breeders
that
they
differed
just
as
mnch
as
their
parents
and
this
judging
by
the
eye
seemed
almost
to
be
the
case
but
on
actually
messuring
the
old
dogs
and
their
six-days
old
puppies
found
that
the
puppies
had
not
nearly
acquired
their
full
amount
of
proportional
differ
ence
so
again
was
told
that
the
foals
of
cart
and
race
horses
differed
as
much
as
the
full-grown
animals
and
this
surprised
me
greatly
as
think
it
probable
that
the
difference
between
these
two
breeds
has
been
wholly
caused
by
selection
under
domestication
but
having
had
carcful
measurements
made
of
the
dam
and
of
three
days
old
colt
of
race
and
heavy
cart-horse
find
that
the
colts
have
by
no
means
acquired
their
full
amount
of
proportional
difference
as
the
evidence
appears
to
me
conclusive
that
the
several
domestic
breeds
of
pigeon
have
descended
from
one
wild
species
compared
young
pigeons
of
various
breeds
within
twelve
hours
af{er
being
hatched
care
fully
measured
the
proportions
but
will
not
here
give
details
of
the
beak
width
of
mouth
length
of
nostril
and
of
eyelid
size
of
feet
and
length
of
leg
in
the
wild
stock
in
};ontcrs
fantails
runts
barbs
dragons
carriers
and
tumblers
now
some
of
these
birds
when
mature
differ
so
extraordinarily
in
length
and
form
of
beak
that
they
would
cannot
doubt
be
ranked
in
distinct
genera
had
they
been
natural
productions
but
when
the
nest
ling
birds
of
these
several
breeds
were
placed
in
row
though
most
of
them
could
be
distinguished
from
each
other
yet
their
proportional
differences
in
the
above
speciticd
several
points
were
incomparably
less
than
in
the
full-grown
birds
some
characteristic
points
of
dif
ference—for
instance
that
of
the
width
of
mouth—could
hardly
be
detected
in
the
young
but
there
was
one
remarkable
exception
to
this
rule
for
the
young
of
the
short-faced
tumbler
differed
from
the
young
of
the
wild

the

the

proves
that
this

either
have

at

at

us
apply
these
facts
and
the

two
prin

latter
though
not
proved
true
can
be
shown
to
be
in
some
degree
probable—to
species
in

of

let
us
take
genus
of
birds
descended
on
my
theory
from
some
one
parent-species
and
of
which
the
several
new
species
have
become
modified
through
patural
selection
in

with
their
diverse
habits
then
from
the
many
slight
successive
steps
of
variation
having
supervened
at

having

the

much
more
closely
than
do
the
adults
just
as
we
have
seen
in
the
case
of
pigeons
we
may
extend
this
view
to
whole
families
or
even
classes
the
fore-limbs

which
served
as
legs

of

on

of

at

whatever
influence
long-continued
exercise
or
use
on

may
have
in

such

affect

has
to

in

by
the

of

in
certain
cases
the
successive
steps
of
variation
might
supervene
from
causes
of
which
we
are
wholly
ignorant
at
very
early
period
of
life

each
step
might
be
in
herited
at
an
earlier
period
than
that
at
which
it
first
a]}l)peared
in
either
case
a8
with
the
short-faced
tumbler
the
young
or
embryo
would
closely
resemble
the
mature
parent-form
we
have
seen
that
this
is
the
rule
of
de
velopment
in
certain
whole
groups
of
animals
as
with
cuttle-fish
and
spiders
and
with
a.few
members
of
the
eat
class
of
insects
as
with
aphis
with
respect
to
the
final
cause
of
the
young
in
these
cases
ot
undergoing
any
metamorphosis
or
closely
resembling
their
parents
from
their
earliest
age
we
can
see
that
this
would
result
from
the
two
following
contingencies
firstly
from
the
young
during
course
of
modification
carried
on
for
many
generations
having
to
provide
for
their
own
wants
at
very
early
stage
of
development
and
secondly
from
their
following
exactly
the
same
habits
of
life
with
their
parents
for
in
this
case
it
would
be
indispensable
for
the
existence
of
the
species
that
the
child
should
be
modified
at
very
early
age
in
the
same
manner
with
its
parents
in
accordance
with
their
similar
habits
some
further
explanation
however
of
the
embryo
not
undergoing
any
metamorphosis
is
perhaps
requisite
if
on
the
other
hand
it
profited
the
young
to
follow
habits
of
life
in

en
on

the

to

from

such
differences
might
also
become
correlated
with
successive
stages

so
that
the
larvee
in
the
first
stage
might
differ
greatly
from
the
larve
in
the
second
stﬁe
a8
we
have
seen
to
be
the
case
with
cirripedes
the

might
become
fitted
for
sites
or
habits
in
which
organs
of
locomotion
or
of
the
senses
&c
would
be
useless
and
in
this
case
the
final
meta~

would
be
said
to
be
e
as
all
the
organic
beings
extinct
and
recent
which
have
ever
lived
on
this
earth
have
to
be
classed
together
and
as
all
have
been
connected
by
the
finest
gradations
the
best
or
indeed
if
our
collections
were
nearly
1pe
ect
the
only
possible
arrangement
would
be
genealogical
descent
being
on
my
view
the
hidden
bond
of
connection
which
naturalists
have
been
seeking
under
the
term
of
the
natural
system
on
this
view
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
in
the
eyes
of
most
naturalists
the
structure
of
the
embryo
is
even
more
important
for
classification
than
that
of
the
adult
for
the
embryo
is
the
animal
in
its
less
modified
state
and
in
so
far
it
reveals
the
struc
ture
of
its
progenitor
in
two
groups
of
animals
however
much
they
may
at
present
differ
from
each
other
in
struc
ture
and
habits
if
they
pass
through
the
same
or
similar
embryonic
stages
we
may
feel
assured
that
they
have
both
descended
from
the
same
or
nearly
similar
parents
and
are
therefore
in
that
degree
closely
related
thus
com
munity
in
embryonic
structure
reveals

of
descent
it
will
reveal
this
community
of
descent
how
ever
much
the
structure
of
the
adult
may
have
been
modified
and
obscured
we
have
seen
for
instance
that
cirripedes
can
at
once
be
recognised
by
their
larvee
as
belonging
to
the
great
class
of
crustaceans
as
the
em

of

and

us
the

it
seems
to
me
the
leading
facts
in

which
are

to
none
in

are
explained
on
the
principle

perhaps
caused
at

and
bein

embryol

rises
greatly
in

when
we
thus
look
at
the
embryo
as
picture
more
or
less
obscured
of
the
com
mon
parent-form
of
each
great
class
of
animals
rudimentary
atrophied
or
aborted
organs—organs
or
parts
in
this
strange
condition
bearing
the
stamp
of
inutility
are
extremely
common
throughout
nature
for
instance
rudimentary
mamme
are
very
general
in
the
males
of
mammals
presume
that
the
bastard-wing
in
birds
may
be
safely
considered
as
digit
in

state
in
very
many
snakes
one
lobe
of
the
lungs
is
rudimentary
in
other
smnakes
there
are
rudiments
of
the
pelvis
and
hind
limbs
some
of
the
cases
of
rudi
mentary
organs
are
extremely
curious
for
instance
the
resence
of
teeth
in
feetal
whales
which
when
grown
up
gave
not

cuar

it
has
even
been

that

be
detected
in
the

of
certain
embryonic

nothing
can
be
plainer
than
that
wings
are
formed
for

yet
in
how
many
insects
do
we
see
wings
so
reduced
in
size
as
to
be
utterly
incapable
of
flight
and
not
rarely
lying
under

tk
soldered
together
meaning
of
rudimentary
organs
is
often
quite
un
mistakeable
for
instance
there
are
beetles
of
the

genus
and
even
of
the
same
species
resembling
each
other
most
closely
in
all
respects
one
of
which
will
have
full-sized
wings
and
another
mere
rudiments
of
mem
brane
and
here
it
is
im%ssible
to
doubt
that
the
rudi

represent
wu:is
udimentary
organs
sometimes
retain
their
potentiality
and
are
merely
not
developed
this
seems
to
be
the
case
with
the

for
many
instances
are
on
record
of
these
organs
having
become
well
developed
in
full-grown

and
having
secreted

so
again
there
are
normally
four

that

that

the
origin
of

is
simple
we
have
plenty
of
cases
of
rudimentary

in
our
domestic
productions
as
the

of

doubt
whether
any
of
these
cases
throw
light
on
the
origin
of
rudimentary
organs
in

of

further
than
by
showing
that
rudiments
can
be
produced
for
doubt
whether
species
under
nature
ever
undergo
abrupt
changes
believe
that
disuse
has
been
the
main
agency
that
it
has
led
in
successive
generations
to
the
gradual
reduc

of
various
organs
until
they
have
become

in

thus
due

have
endeavoured
to
give
to
them
their
full
force
nothing
at
first
can
appear
more
difficult
to
believe
than
that
the
more
complex
or
gans
and
instincts
should
have
been
perfected
not
by
means
superior
to
though
analogous
with
human
reason
but
by
the
accumulation
of
innumerable
slight
variations
each
good
for
the
individual
possessor
nevertheless
this
difliculty
though
appearing
to
our
imagination
insupera
bly
great
cannot
be
considered
real
if
we
admit
the
foflow
ing
propositions
namely,—that
gradations
in
the
perfec
tion
of
any
organ
or
instinct
which
we
may
consider
either
do
now
exist
or
could
have
existed
each
good
of
its
kind,—that
all
organs
and
instincts
are
in
ever
so
slight
degree
variable,—and
lastly
that
there
is
strug
le
for
existence
leading
to
the
preservation
of
each
prof
itable
deviation
of
structure
or
instinct
the
truth
of
these
propositions
cannot
think
be
disputed
it
is
no
doubt
extremely
difficult
even
to
conjecture
by
what
gradations
many
structures
have
been
perfected

especially
amongst
broken

ganic

but
we
see
so
many
gradations
in
nature
as
18
proclaimed
by
the
canon
natura
non
facit
saltum
that
we
ought
to
be
extremely
cautious
in
saying
that
any
organ
or
instinct
or
any
whole
being
could
not
have
arrived
at
its
present
state
by
many
graduated
steps
there
are
it
must
be
admitted
cases
of
special
difficulty
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
and
one
of
the
most
curious
of
these
is
the
existence
of
two
or
three
defined
castes
of
workers
or
sterile
females
in
the
same
community
of
ants
but
have
attempted
to
show
how
this
difficulty
can
be
mastered
with
respect
to
the
almost
universal
sterility
of
spe
cies
when
f{’rst
crossed
which
forms
so
remarkable
contrast
with
the
almost
universal
fertility
of
varieties
when
crossed
must
refer
the
reader
to
the
recapitula
tion
of
the
facts
given
at
the
end
of
the
eighth
chapter
which
seem
to
me
conclusively
to
show
that
this
sterility
is
no
more
sgecial
endowment
than
is
the
incapacity
of
two
trees
to
be
grafted
together
but
that
it
is
inci
dental
on
constitutional
differences
in
the
reproductive
systems
of
the
intercrossed
species
we
see
the
truth
of
this
conclusion
in
the
vast
difference
in
the
result
when
the
same
two
species
are
crossed
reciprocally
that
is
when
one
species
is
first
used
as
the
father
and
then
as
the
mother
the
fertility
of
varieties
when
intercrossed
and
of
their
mongrel
offspring
cannot
be
considered
as
universal
nor
is
their
very
general
fertility
surprising
when
we
remem
ber
that
it
18
not
likely
that
either
their
constitutions
or
their
reproductive
systems
should
have
been
profoundly
modified
moreover
most
of
the
varieties
which
have
been
experimentised
on
have
been
produced
under
do
mestication
and
as
domestication
apparently
tends
to
eliminate
sterility
we
ought
not
to
expect
it
also
to
pro
duce
sterility
the
sterility
of
hybrids
is
very
different
case
from
that
of
first
crosses
for
their
reproductive
organs
are
more
or
less
functionally
impotent
whereas
in
first
crosses
the
organs
on
both
sides
are
in
a
perfect
con
dition
as
we
continually
see
that
organisms
of
all
kinds
onir

recapitulation
401
are
rendered
in
some
degree
sterile
from
their
constitutions
having
been
disturbed
by
slightly
different
and
new
con
ditions
of
life
we
need
not
feel
surprise
at
hybrids
being
in
some
degree
sterile
for
their
constitutions
can
hardly
fail
to
have
been
disturbed
from
being
compounded
of
two
distinet
organisations
this
parallelism
is
su}fzported
by
another
parallel
but
directly
opposite
class
of
facts
namely
that
the
vigour
and
fertility
of
all
organic
beings
are
increased
by
slight
changes
in
their
conditions
of
life
and
that
the
offspring
of
slightly
modified
forms
or
varie
ties
acquire
from
being
crossed
increased
vigour
and
fer
tility
so
that
on
the
one
hand
considerable
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
and
crosses
between
greatly
modified
forms
lessen
fertility
and
on
the
other
hand
lesser
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
and
crosses
between
less
modified
forms
increase
fertility
turning
to
geographical
distribution
the
difficulties
encountered
on
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
are
grave
enough
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
spe
cies
and
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
or
even
higher
group
must
have
desoended
from
common
parents
and
therefore
in
however
distant
and
isolated
parts
of
the

they
are
now
found
they
must
in
the
course
of
suc
cessive

have
passed
from
some
one
part
to
the
others
we
are
often
wholly
unable
even
to
conjecture
how
this
could
have
been
effected
yet
as
we
have
rea

to
believe
that
some

that
we

of
the

climatal

both
of

many
occasional

of
transport
with

to
distinct
species
of
the

as
the
process
of

has
necessarily
been
slow
all
the

of

will
have
been
possible
during

and
consequently
the
difficulty
of
the
wide
diftusion
of

of

is
in
some
degree
lessened
as
on
the
theory

an

have
existed
linking
together
all

why

they

overthrow
the
theory
of

with

now
let
us
turn
to
the
other
side
of
the
argument
under
domestication
we
see
much
variability
seems
to
be
mainly
due
to
the
reproductive
system
being
eminentg
susceptible
to
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
g0
that
this
system
when
not
rendered
impotent
fails
to
reproduce
offspring
exactly
like
the
parent-form
va
riability
is
governed
by
many
complex
laws,—by
correla
tion
of
growth
by
use
and
disuse
and
by
the
direct
action
of
the
physical
conditions
of
life
there
is
much
difficulty
in
ascertaining
how
much
modification
our
domestic
pro
ductions
have
undergone
but
we
may
safely
infer
that
the
amount
has
been
large
and
that
modifications
can
be
inherited
for
long
periods
as
long
as
the
conditions
of
life
remain
the
same
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
modification
which
has
already
been
inherited
for
many
enerations
may
continue
to
be
inherited
for
an
almost
mfinite
number
of
generations
on
the
other
hand
we
have
evidence
that
variability
when
it
has
once
come
into
play
does
not
wholly
cease
for
new
varieties
are
still
occasionally
produced
by
our
most
anciently
domesti
cated
productions
man
does
not
actually
produce
variability
he
only
unintentionally
exposes
organic
beings
to
new
conditions
of
life
and
then
nature
acts
on
the
organisation
and
causes
variability
but
man
can
and
does
select
the
variations
iven
to
him
by
nature
and
thus
accumulate
them
in
any
desired
manner
he
thus
adapts
animals
and
piants
for
his

without

it
is

that
he
can
largely
influence
the
character
of

by
selecting
in

individual
differences
so
slight
as
to
be
quite
inngfreciable
by
an
uneducated
eye
this
process
of

has
been
the
agency

of

by
the
inextricable
doubts
whether

there
is
no
obvious
reason
why
the
principles
which
have
acted
so

under

should
not
have
acted
under

from

this
high

is
proved
by

besides

all

have
admitted

correlation

seems
to
have

in

how

is
the

of

on

of
the

of
the

and
in
their

how
simply
is
this
fact
explained
if
we
believe
that
these

have
descended
from
striped
progeni

in
the
same
manner
as
the
several-domestic

of
pigeon
have
descended
from
the
blue

barred

pigeon
on
the
ordinary
view
of
each

having
been

created
why
should
the
specific
characters
or
those
by
which
the

of
the

genus
differ
from
each

be
more
variable
than
the
generic
char
acters
in
which
they
all
agree
why
for

should
the
colour
of
flower
be
more
likely
to
vary
in
any
one
species
of
genus
if
the
other

supposed
to
have

have
differently
coloured

than
if
all

if

are
only
well-marked
va
rieties
of
which
the
characters
have
become
in
high
degree
permanent
we
can
understand
this
fact
for
they
have
already
varied
since
they
branched
off
from
com
mon
progenitor
in
certain
characters
by
which
they
have
come
to
be
specifically
distinet
from
each

and
therefore
these

characters
would
be
more
likely
still
to
be
variable
than
the
generic
characters
which
have
been
inherited
without
change
for
an
enormous
period
it
is
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
creation
why
part
developed
in
very
unusual
manner
in
any
one
species
of
genus
and
therefore
as
we
may
naturally
infer
of
great
importance
to
the
species
should
be
eminently
liable
to
variation
but
on
my
view
this
part
has
undergone
since
the
several
species
branched
off
from
common
progenitor
an
unusual
amount
of
variability
and
modifi
cation
and
therefore
we
might
expect
this
part
generally
to
be
still
variable
but
part
may
be
developed
in
the
419
recapitulation
omar

most
unusual
manner
like
the
wing
of
bat
and
tzet
not
to
be
more
variable
than
any
other
structure
if
the
part
be
common
to
many
subordinate
forms
that
is
if
it
has
becn
inherited
for
very
long
period
for
in
this
case
it
will
have
been
rendered
comstant
by
long-continued
natural
selection
glancing
at
instincts
marvellous
as
some
are
they
offer
no
greater
difficulty
than
does
corporeal
structure
on
the
theory
of
the
natural
selection
of
successive
slight
but
profitable
modifications
we
can
thus
understand
why
nature
moves
by
graduated

in
endowing
differ
ent
animals
of
the

with
their

how
much

the

throws
on
the

powers
of
the

habit
no
doubt
sometimes
comes
into

in

but
it
certainly
is
not
indis
})ensable
as
we
see
in
the
case
of
neuter
msects
which
eave
no
progeny
to
inherit
the
effects
of
long-continued
habit
on
the
view
of
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
having
descended
from
common
parent
and
having
inherited
much
in
common
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
allied
species
when
placed
under
considerably
differ
ent
conditions
of
life
yet
should
follow
nearly
the
same
instincts
why
the
thrush
of
south
america
for
instance
lines
her
nest
with
mud
like
our
british
species
on
the
view
of
instincts
having
been
slowly
acquired
through
natural
selection
we
need
not
marvel
at
some
instincts
being
apparently
not
perfect
and
liable
to
mistakes
and
at
many
instincts
causing
other
animals
to
suffer
if
species
be
only
well-marked
and
permanent
varie

we
can
at
once
see
why
their
crossed
offspring
should
follow
the

complex
laws
in
their
degrees
and
kinds
of
resemblance
to

by

and
in

such
points
as
do
the

on

these
would
be
strange
facts
if

have

and

have
been

by
secondary

if
we

then
such

support
the

new

have

the

neither

the

causes
the

the

in

is

explained
by

in

the
grand

that

the

as
the

which

the

with

will
often
be
intermediate
in

in

with

and
thus
we
can
see
why
the

the
oftener
it
stands
in
some

intermediate
between

ups
ent
forms

looked
at
as
being

they

that

almost

now

plain
evidence

the
chief
cause
of
our
natural
unwillingness
to

that

that

to
me
strange

admit

multitnde
of

which
till
lately
they
themselves
thought
were

which
are
still
thus
looked
at
by
the

of
naturalists
and
which
conse

have
every
external
characteristic
feature
of
true
species,—they
admit
that
these
have
been
produced
by
variation
but
they
refuse
to
extend
the
same
view
to
other
and
very
slightly
different
forms
nevertheless
they
do
not
pretend
that
they
an
define
or
even
conjecture
which
are
the
created
forms
of
life
and
which
are
those
pro
duced
by
secondary
laws
they
admit
variation
as

case
they
arbitrarily
reject
it
in

this

these
authors
seem
no
more
startled
at
miraculous
act

creation
than
at
an
ordinary
birth
but
do
they
really
believe
that
at
innumerable
periods
in
the
earth’s
history
certain
elemental
atoms
have
been
commanded
suddenl
to
flash
into

they

it
may
be
asked
how
far
extend
the
doctrine
of

of

the
question
is
difficult
to
an
swer
because
the
more
distinct
the

we
may
consider

so

the
arguments
fall
away

some
arguments
of

test

extend
very
far
all
the
members
of
whole
classes
can
be
con
nected
together
by
chains
of
affinities
and
all
can
be
classified
on
the
same
principle
in
groups
subordinate
to

sometimes
tend
to
fill
up
very
wide
intervals

orders
organs
in

dimentary
condition
{)lainly
show
that
an
early
progenitor
had
the
organ
in
fully
developed
state
and
this
in
some
instances
necessarily
implies
an
enormous
amount
of
mod
ification
in
the
descendants
throughout
whole
classes
various
structures
are
formed
on
the
same
pattern
and
at
an
embryonic
age
the
species
closely
resemble
each
other
therefore
cannot
doubt
that
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
embraces
all
the
members
of
the
same
class
believe
that
animals
have
descended
from
at
most
only
four
or
five
progenitors
and
plants
from
an
equal
or
lesser
number
analogy
would
lead
me
one
step
further
namely
to
the
belief
that
all
animals
and
plants
have
descended
from
some
one
prototype
but
analogy
may
be
deceitful
guide
nevertheless
all
living
things
have
much
in
com
mon
in
their
chemical
composition
their
germinal
vesicles
their
cellular
structure
and
their
laws
of
growth
and
re
production
we
see
this
even
in
so
trifling
circumstance
as
that
the

poison
often
similarly
affects

animals
or
that
the
poison
secreted

therefore
shoulgr
infer
from
analogy
that
probably
all
the
organic
beings
which
have
ever
lived
on
this
earth
have
%escended
from
some
one
primordial
form
into
which
life
was
first
breathed
when
the
views
entertained
in
this
volume
on
the
origin
of

when
analogous
views
are

this

will
have
only
to

that
this
will
be

whether
any
form
be
sufficiently

from

to
be
capable

definition
and
if
definable
whether
the

be

will

it
is
at

however
slight
between

forms
if
not

are
looked
at
by
most
naturalists
as
sufficient
to
raise
both
forms
to
the
rank
of
species
hereafter
we
shall
be
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
the
only
distinction
between
species
and
well-marked
varieties
is
that
the
latter
are
known
or
believed
to
be
connected
at
the
present
day
by
interme
diate
gradations
whereas
species
were
formerly
thus
con
nected
hence
without
quite
rejecting
the
consideration
of
the
present
existence
of
intermediate
gradations
between
any
two
forms
we
shall
be
led
to
weigh
more
carefully
and
to
value
higher
the
actual
amount
of
difference
be

them
it
is
quite
possible
that
forms
now
general
ly
acknowledged
to
be
merely
varieties
may
hereafter
be
ought
worthy
of
specific
names
as
with
the
primrose
and
cowslip
and
in
this
case
scientific
and
common
lan
guage
will
come
into

in

we
shall
have
to
treat
species
in
the
same
manner
as
those
naturalists
treat
genera
who
admit
that
genera
are
merely
artificial
combinations
made
for
convenience
this
may
not
be
cheering
prospect
but
we
shall
at

be
freed
from
the
vain
search
for
the
undiscovered
and

and
insert
as
follows
on
the
state
of
development
of
ancient
compared
with
living
forms
have
seen
in
the
fourth
chapter
that
the
degree
of
differentiation
and
specialisation
of
the
parts
of
all
organic
beings
when
come
to
maturity
is
the
best
standard
as
yet
suggested
of
their
degree
of
perfection
or
highness
we
have
also
seen
that
as
the
specialisation
of
parts
or
organs
is
an
advantage
to
each
being
so
natu
ral
selection
will
constantly
ten%
thus
to
render
the
or
ganisation
of
each
more
specialised
and
perfect
and
in
this
sense
higher
not
but
that
it
may
and
will
leave
maux
creatures
fitted
for
simple
conditions
of
life
with
simple
and
unimproved
structures
in
another
and
more
general
manner
we
can
see
that
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
the
more
recent
forms
will
tend
to
be
higher
than
their
progenitors
for
each
new
species
is
formed
by
baving

advantage
in
the
struggle
for

climate
the
ocene
inhabitants
of
one
quarter
of
the
world
were
put
into
competition
with
the
existing
inhabitants
of
the
same
or
some
other
quarter
the
eocene
fauna
or
flora
would
certainly
be
beaten
and
exterminated
as
would
secondary
fauna
by
an
eocene
and
paleozoic
fauna
by
secondary
fanna
so
that
by
this
fundamental
test
of
victory
in
the
battle
for
life
as
well
as
by
the
standard
of
the
specialisation
of
organs
modern
forms
ought
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
to
stand
higher
than
an
cient
forms
is
this
the
case
large
majority
of
pa
leeontologists
would
certainly
answer
in
the
affirmative
but
in
my
imperfect
judgment
can
after
having
read
the
discussions
on
this
subject
by
lyell
and
by
hooker
in
regard
to
plants
concur
only
to
cretain
limited
extent
nevertheless
it
may
be
anticipated
that
the
evidence
will
be
rendered
more
decisive
by
future
geological
research
the
problem
is
in
many
ways
excessively
intricate
the
geological
record
at
all
times
imperfect
does
not
ex
tend
far
enough
back
as
believe
to
show
with
unmis
takable
clearness
that
within
the
known
history
of
the
world
organisation
has
largely
advanced
even
at
the
present
day
looking
to
members
of
the
same
class
natu
ralists
are
not
unanimous
which
forms
are
highest
thus
some
look
at
the
selaceans
or
sharks
from
their
approach
in
some
important
point
of
structure
to
reptiles
as
the
highest
fish
others
look
at
the
teleosteans
gs
the
highest
the
ganoids
stand
intermediate
between
the
selaceans
and
teleosteans
the
latter
at
the
present
day
are
largely
preponderant
in
number
but
formerly
selaceans
and
ga
noids
alone
existed
and
in
this
case
according
to
the
standard
of
highness
chosen
so
will
it
be
said
that
fishes
have
advanced
or
have
retrograded
in
organisation
to
attempt
to
compare
in
the
scale
of
highness
members
of
distinct
types.seems
hopeless
;
who
will
decide
whether
cuttle-fish
be

a-bee
that
insect
which
the
great
von
baer
believed
to
be
in
fact
more
highly
or
ganised
than
fish
although
upon
another
type
in
the
complex
struggle
for
life
it
is
quite
credible
that
crusta
ceans
for
instance
not
very
high
in
their
own
class
might
beat
the
cephalopods
or

and

taceans
though
not
highly
developed
wonld
stand
very
high
in
the
scale
of
invertebrate
animals
if
judged
by
the
most
decisive
of
all
trials,—the
law
of
battle
besides
this
inherent
difficulty
in
deciding
which
forms
are
the
most
advanced
in
organization
we
ought
not
solely
to
compare
the
highest
members
of
class
at
any
two
distant
periods,—though
undoubtedly
this
is
one
and
perhaps
the
most
important
element
in
striking
balance
but
we
ought
to
compare
all
the
members
high
and
low
at
the
two
periods
at
an
ancient
epoch
the
ﬁighest
and
lowest
molluscs—namely
cephalopods
and
brachio
pods—swarmed
in
numbers
at
the
present
time
both
these
orders
have
been
greatly
reduced
whereas
other
or
ders
intermediate
in
grade
of
organisation
have
largely
increased
consequently
some
naturalists
have
maintained
that
molluscs
were
formerly
more
highly
developed
than
at
present
but
stronger
case
can
be
made
out
on
the
other
side
by
considering
the
vast
reduction
at
the
present
day
of
the
lowest
molluscs
more
especially
as
the
exist
ing
cephalopods
thongh
so
few
in
number
are
more
highly
organised
than
their
ancient
represcntatives
we
ought
also
to
consider
the
relative
proportional
numbers
of
the
high
and
low
classes
in
the
population
of
the
world
at
the
two
periods
if
for
instance
at
the
present
day
there
were
fifty
thousand
kinds
of
vertebrate
animals
and
if
we
had
resson
to
believe
that
at
some
former
period
there
were
only
ten
thousand
kinds
we
ought
to
look
at
this
increase
in
number
of
the
highest
class
which
implies
great
displacement
of
lower
forms
as
decided
advance
in
the
organisation
of
the
world
whether
or
not
it
were
the
higher
vertebrata
which
had
thus
largely
increased
we
can
thus
see
how
hopelessly
difficult
it
will
appa
rently
forever
be
to
compare
with
perfect
fairness

extremely
complex
relations
the
standard
of

of

history
we
shall
appreciate
under
one
important
point
of
view
this
difficulty
the
more
clearly
by
looking
to
the
case
of
certain

much
in

in
their

their

their

and
their
liability
to

we
see
this
in

trifling
circumstance
as
that
the

similarly

that

if

to
the
two
main
divisions—namely
to
the
animal

vegetable
kingdoms—certain
low

are
so

intermediate

that

have
disputed
to
which
kingdom
they
should
be
referred

on
the
principle
of

with

it
does
not
seem
utterly
incredible
that
from
some
such
intermediate
production
both
animals

should
infer
that
probably
all
